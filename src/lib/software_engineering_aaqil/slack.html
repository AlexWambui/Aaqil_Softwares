                <p>Slack is a messaging app for business that connects people with the information they need.</p>
                <p>It brings people together to work as one unified team and transforms the way organisations comunicate.</p>
                <p>Connected - People can work in dedicated spaces called channels that bring together the right people and information.</p>
                <p>Flexible - when work is organized into channels, no matter your location, time zone or function, you can access the information you need on your own time.</p>

                <h2 class="_heading2">Channels</h2>
                <p>Slack organizes conversations into dedicated spaces called channels.</p>
                <p>Channels bring order and clarity to work - you can create then for any project, topic or team.</p>
                <p>With the right people and information in one place, teams can share ideas, make decisions and move work forward.</p>

                <p class="title">The #general channel</p>
                <p>Every Slack workspace has a #general channel, which is the only channel that members (but not guests) are automatically added to and unable to leave.</p>
                <p>This channel works best when it's used for sharing workspace-wide announcements.</p>
                <p>The channel can be archived, deleted or converted to a private channel.</p>

                <h2 class="_heading2">Threads</h2>
                <p>Threads help create an organized discussion around a specific message.</p>
                <p>They let you discuss a topic in more detail without adding clutter to a channel or direct message (DM) conversation.</p>

                <h2 class="_heading2">Huddle</h2>
                <p>Is a lightweight audio call that lets you and members of your team talk to each other in real-time.</p>
                <p>A way for peers to have informal audio conversations just like they would in a physical office setting.</p>
                <p>A good reason to start a huddle would be:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To help out a peer with a task or a project.</li>
                    <li>To do a manual review for a project which requires asking questions.</li>
                    <li>Pair programming - peer learning.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A huddle can hold around 50 people.</p>

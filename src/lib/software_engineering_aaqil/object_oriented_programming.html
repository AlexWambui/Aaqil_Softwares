                <p>OOP enables us to build complex software systems employing many of the techniques used for constructing complex physical systems like cars, airplanes or buildings.</p>
                <p>To understand OOP, you can think of Alan Kay - Coiner of "Object-Oriented" who was pursuing a vision where everybody could pick a personal computer (dynabook) and become a productive software developer in it.</p>
                <p>He was an undergrad biology grad and this shaped most of his metaphor about OOP that it's related to how a human is a collection of many related cells that form organs which are a collection of small cells too.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, think of Imperative  programming as a clock work machine. Every gear hooks up to every other gear but remove one little gear and the whole thing breaks down. Contrast this with cells, each cell is not so crucial to the functioning of the body so a cell might die but the body will still continue to function.</p>
                <p>Alan Kay had in mind that a program could be a recursive composition of tiny programs called objects connected in some way to form the bigger picture.</p>
                <p>Alan Kay also emphasized "I'm sorry that I long ago coined the term "objects" for this topic because it gets many people to focus on the lesser idea. The big idea is "messaging"".</p>
                <p>Messaging being the kind of glue that enables the tiny programs to communicate with each other to form the bigger, flexible and scalable programs.</p>
                <p>Learn to think of objects in terms of what they do instead of what they are and how they interact.</p>

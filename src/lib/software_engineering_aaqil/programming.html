                <p class="note_better">The best way to learn a new programming language is to write programs in it.</p>
                <p>Programming is mostly the practical math which is mostly about logic.</p>
                <p>Programming well, like writing well, takes years of practice.</p>
                <p>Programming is breaking down a task into small steps.</p>
                <p>Computers are stupid; since they just sit and do whatever mindless task they're told to do for days, weeks, months or years on end without any complaints or any slacking off.</p>
                <p>A computer can also erase it's own hard disk (a bit like deleting all your memories then pulling parts of your brain out.)</p>
                <p>Computers are completely obedient. ie. No matter how crazed your instructions might be, your computer will carry them out precisely.</p>

            <div class="container">
                <p>When learning a new language, look at the:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Learn the basics and fundamentals (flow of a program, expressions, statements, statement blocks, functions, errors)</li>
                    <li>looks at concepts such as: (Data types[bit, byte, short, integer, long, float, double, boolean, char, primitive vs Non-Primitive], Data structures[arrays, arraylists, linkedlist, stack, queues, graphs, trees, hashtable, sets, heaps])</li>
                    <li>Learn object-oriented programming.(Classes, abstract classes, interfaces) then core concepts of OOP(Inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction)</li>
                    <li>learn algorithms(recursion, searching algorithms[depth first search, breath first search, binary search], sorting algorithms[merge sort, quick sort, insertion sort, selection sort])</li>
                    <li>learn web development(HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Angular, Vue)</li>
                    <li>learn git and GitHub and upload your projects</li>
                    <li>work on simple projects as you're learning.(helps practice the fundamentals and optimization of code)</li>
                    <li>Syntax of the language</li>
                    <li>variable types (esp in c but not really all languages)</li>
                    <li>how to declare variables</li>
                    <li>how to initialize variables</li>
                    <li>how to use the variables in the program</li>
                    <li>how to write expressions</li>
                    <li>how to write statements</li>

                <h2 class="_heading2">Preparing to program</h2>
                <p>There's usually certain steps to take when solving a problem.</p>
                <p>First, define the problem. If you don't know what the problem is, you can't find a solution!</p>
                <p>Devise a plan to fix it - Once you know what the problem is, you can devise a plan to fix it.</p>
                <p>Implement the plan - Once you have a plan, you can usually implement it.</p>
                <p>Test the results - Once the plan is implemented, you must test the results to see whether the problem is solved.</p>
                <p>The sequence of steps is:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Determine the objective(s) of the program.</li>
                    <li>Determine the methods you want to use in writing the program - this includes knowing what information needs to be tracked, what formulas will be used, what you need to know and in what order the solution should be implemented.</li>
                    <li>Create the program to solve the problem.</li>
                    <li>Run the program to see the results.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2 class="_heading2">The Program Development Cycle</h2>
                <p>The program development cycle has its own steps.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>use an editor to create a disk file containing your source code.</li>
                    <li>compile the source code to create an object file.</li>
                    <li>link the compiled code to create an executable file.</li>
                    <li>run the program to see whether it works as originally planned.</li>
                </ol>

                <ul>
                    <li>Freelancing - Just market your skill correctly no matter how basic it is. As you get better at your skill, get to know how much time and effort a project is going to take, you can raise your price or at least price accordingly.</li>
                    <li>Tutoring - can be through a Youtube channel or in person training. Here, word of mouth is really powerful as it gets you more clients.</li>
                    <li>Share you knowledge online - This open you up to people easily being able to find you on the internet. When people view your content, some can end up emailing you and you can end up building a whole network of potential clients who want you to do something for them.</li>
                    <li>Build a product or service that you can sell - this can be a bit challenging. Build something that people might want to use and it can slowly grow like for example the big tech companies. Or make a service you can sell to a company.</li>
                    <li>Help local businesses by providing automated solutions - like you can create a website for them or a program that automates a process that could increase the efficiency of the business. A good way to do this would be to convince the business that it's high time they get a website to get more competitive plus the fee you charge they will easily recover from just one client who comes to them through that website.</li>

            <div class="container">
                <p>programmers tell computers what to do. Computers require these instructions to be precise and complete in every way.</p>
                <p>Programmers think in an unnatural way because they break down tasks into small steps and that's not the way the brain works.</p>
                <p>Humans aren't usually good at giving precise and complete instructions since we have this incredible brains which lets us give vague commands and still get correct answers. Thus programmers have to think in an unnatural way.</p>
                <p>They have to learn to take a description of a task and break it down into the fundamental steps which a computer needs to know in order to perform the task.</p>

                <h2 class="_heading2">Traits of a good Programmer</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Logical - being logical helps organise and construct complex programs and to break a task down into necessary individual steps.</li>
                    <li>Patient</li>
                    <li>Perceptive - this is to notice that the 20 consecutive hours you've spent in front of your computer have depleted your body's energy resources to nearly fatal levels and you'll die whilst designing an icon for your new application. (Avoid this problem by designing the icon before writing the program).</li>
                    <li>At least moderately intelligent - and also be a star trek fan.</li>
                    <li>Enjoys an intellectual challenge - this helps you to enjoy programming as it can be intellectually challenging.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="container">
                <p>Both Web Dev and Software Eng. involve programming and craftsmanship but software engineering adds to it knowledge of data structures and algorithms, compiled languages, memory considerations and understanding the impact of coding and architecture decisions on the machines where they reside.</p>
                <p>Large companies that hire software engineers expect candidates to have this knowledge.</p>
                <p>Companies like google set a very high bar for hiring. They want to hire only the best. So if you set your sight high (getting hired at big Tech companies) you still be quite hireable elsewhere.</p>
                <p>Big companies reward merit, encourage big ideas and give employees the freedom to make good decisions for the user.</p>
                <p>The companies hire smart and passionate people base on coding ability amd technical knowledge.</p>
                <p>Like any startup with a big goal, you make mistakes and do things that waste time.</p>
                <p><b>It's good to ask, not assume.</b></p>
                <p>Start coding problems sooner.</p>
                <p>Space repetition is the key to memorization. Once you learn something, review it again later and again even later. At each repetition you reinforce learning. Spending hours and hours at one time on priority ques won't make you an expert. You become an expert by revisiting and reviewing over time. This get you to a point you can't forget details.</p>
                <p>Know algorithms that will save computing resources of time, space and I/O.</p>

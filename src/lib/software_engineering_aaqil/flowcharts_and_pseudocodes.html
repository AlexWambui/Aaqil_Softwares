						<h2 class="_heading2">What is a Flowchart</h2>
						<p>A flowchart is a type of diagram that visually represents a workflow or process using a set of symbols or icons to denote different actions/decisions/steps within the process with arrows showing the direction of the flow.</p>
                                                <p>Flowcharts are used across many different professions to help analyze, design, document, and/or manage a workflow or process.</p>

                                                <h2 class="_heading2">Why use a flowchart?</h2>
                                                <p>Similar to psuedo-code, flowcharts provide another way of approaching and/or understanding a workflow.</p>
                                                <p>Another benefit is that, when done well, flowcharts can be understood by non-developers and by developers that do not know the language the process is written in.</p>

                                                <h2 class="_heading2">Flowchart Symbols</h2>
                                                <p>Due to flowcharts being used across many industries, many sets of symbols and styles have been created with a specific industry in mind.</p>
                                                <p>A good symbol set to use is the ISO 5807 symbol set, as they are well-known and often used in the technology industry.</p>

                                                <h3 class="_heading3">Commonly used ISO 5807 symbols:</h3>

						<h1>Example of flowchart</h1>

						<h2 class="_heading2">Good uses of flowchart:</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Create a flowchart before coding a task to either help create or validate pseudo-code.</li>
							<li>Add to a README.md to visually show how your project/process works.</li>
							<li>Use in a presentation to aide audience understand.</li>
							<li>Your function or process is not working as expected? Create a flowchart of how it CURRENTLY is. Then, walk through the chart with some example input.</li>						
						</ul>
						<p>A flowchart can be as high-level or as detailed as you want.</p>
						<p>For example: you could break the flowchart above down further to include what is happening in memory.</p>
						<p>You can even create flowcharts from your everyday non-technical experiences.</p>
						<p>Choosing a movie or a place to eat could be displayed as a flow-chart!</p>

						<h2 class="_heading2">How to write pseudo code</h2>
						<p>pseudo-code is a term often used in programming and algorithm based fields.</p>
						<p>It's a methodology that allow programmers to represent the implementation of an algorithm.</p>
						<p>Often at times, algorithms are represented with the help of pseudo codes as they can be interpreted by programmers no matter what their programming background or knowledge is.</p>
						<p>Pseudo-code, as the name suggests, is a false code or a representation of code which can be understood by evern a layman with some school level programming knowledge.</p>
						<p>Algorith - is an organized logical sequence of the actions or the approach towards a particular problem.</p>
						<p>A programmer implements an algorith to solve a problem.</p>
						<p>Algorithms are expressed using natural verbal but somewhat technical annotations.</p>
						<p>Pseudo code - is simply an implementation of an algorithm in the form of annotations and informative text wriiten in plain English.</p>
						<p>It has no syntax like any of the programming languages and thus can't be compiled or interpreted by the computer.</p>
						<p class="title">Advantages of pseudo code</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Improves readability of any approach. It's one of the best approaches to start implementation of an algorith.</li>
							<li>Acts as a bridge between the program and the algorith or flowchart. Also works as a rough documentation, so the program of one developer can be understood easily when a pseudo code is written out. In industries, the approach of documentation is essential. And that’s where a pseudo-code proves vital.</li>
							<li>The main goal of a pseudo code is to explain what exactly each line of a program should do, hence making the code construction phase easier for the programmer.</li>
						</ul>
						<h3 class="_heading3">Writing a pseudo-code</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>The main goal of a pseudo-code is to explain what exactly each line of a program should do, hence making the code construction phase easier for the programmer.</li>
							<li>Start with the statement of a pseudo code which establishes the main goal or the aim. eg. This program will allow users to check whether a number is even or odd.</li>
							<li>The way the if-else, for, while loops are indented in a program, indent the statements likewise, as it helps to comprehend the decision control and execution mechanism. They also improve the readability to a great extent.</li>
							<li>Use appropriate naming conventions. The human tendency follows the approach to follow what we see. If a programmer goes through a pseudo code, his approach will be the same as per it, so the naming must be simple and distinct.</li>
							<li>Use appropriate sentence casings, such as CamelCase for methods, upper case for constants and lower case for variables.</li>
							<li>Elaborate everything which is going to happen in the actual code. Don’t make the pseudo code abstract.</>
							<li>Use standard programming structures such as ‘if-then’, ‘for’, ‘while’, ‘cases’ the way we use it in programming.</li>
							<li>Check whether all the sections of a pseudo code is complete, finite and clear to understand and comprehend.</li>
							<li>Don’t write the pseudo code in a complete programmatic manner. It is necessary to be simple to understand even for a layman or client, hence don’t incorporate too many technical terms.</li>
						</ol>

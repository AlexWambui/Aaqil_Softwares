                                                <p>In real-world projects, your brain should be able to write a quick efficient solution for complicated stuff and you can only do that when you practice a lot of coding questions.</p>
                                                <p>Understand that language and frameworks are just tools, they won't teach you problem-solving skills.</p>
                                                <p>You develop problem-solving skills when you practice a lot of coding questions.</p>
                                                <p>Every developer has their own tricks and they follow their own pattern to solve coding problems but when it comes to new developers, they are always uncertain about where to start.</p>
                                                <p>Many understand the problems, the logic, and the basics of syntax, they also understand someone else codes and they can follow along with them but when it comes to solving the questions on their own, they get stuck.</p>
                                                <p>They don't undertand how to turn their thoughts into code even though they understand the syntax or logic.</p>
                                                
                                                <h2 class="_heading2">How to effectively approach a coding problem</h2>
                                                <p class="title">Step 1: Understand and Analyze the problem.</p>
                                                <p>It doesn't matter if you have seen the question in the past or not, read the question several times and understand it completely.</p>
                                                <p>Now, think about the question and analyze it carefully.</p>
                                                <p>Sometimes we read a few lines and assume the rest of the things on our own but a slight chagne in your question can change a lot of things in your code so be careful about that.</p>
                                                <p>Take a pen and paper and write down everything. What's given (input) and what you need to find out (output)? While going through the problem you need to ask a few questions yourself...</p>
                                                <p>Did you understand the problem fully?</p>
                                                <p>Would you be able to explain this question to someone else?</p>
                                                <p>What and how many inputs are required?</p>
                                                <p>What would be the output for those inputs?</p>
                                                <p>Do you need to separate out some modules or parts from the problem?</p>
                                                <p>Do you have enough information to solve that question?</p>
                                                <p class="title">Step 2: Go through the sample data and examples thoroughly</p>
                                                <p>When you try to understand the problem, take some sample inputs and try to analyze the output.</p>
                                                <p>The sample inputs will help you to understand the problem in a better way.</p>
                                                <p>You will also get clarity about how many cases your code can handle and what will be the possible output or output range.</p>
                                                <p>Consider some simple inputs or data and analyze the ouput.</p>
                                                <p>Consider some complex and bigger input and identify what will the output and how many cases you need to take for the problem.</p>
                                                <p>Consider the edge cases as well.</p>
                                                <p>Analyze what would the the output if there is no input or if you give some valid input.</p>
                                                <p class="title">Step 3: Break Down the problem when you see a coding question that is complex or big, instead or being afraid and getting confused.</p>
                                                <p>Break down the problem into smaller chunks and then try to solve each part of the problem.</p>
                                                <p class="title">Step 4: Make a flow chart for the problem at hand.</p>
                                                <p>Divid the problem into sub-problems or smaller chunks.</p>
                                                <p>Solve the sub-problems.</p>
                                                <p>Make independent functions for each sub-problem.</p>
                                                <p>Connect the solutions of each sub-problem by calling them in the required order, or as necessary.</p>
                                                <p>Wherever it's required, use classes and objects while handling questions (for real-world problems like management systems, etc)</p>
                                                <p class="title">Step 4: Write pseudocode, make a flowchart</p>
                                                <p>Before jumping into the solution, it's always good to write psudocode for the problem.</p>
                                                <p>Basically, pseudocode defines the structure of your code and helps you write every line of code that you need in order to solve the problem.</p>
                                                <p>Reading pseudocode give a clear idea that of what your code is supposed to do.</p>
                                                <p>A lot of people or experienced programmers skip this step but when you write pseudocode the process of writing the final code becomes easier for you.</p>
                                                <p>In the end, you will have to only translate each line of pseudocode into actual code.</p>
                                                <p>So write down every step and logic in your pseudocode.</p>
                                                <p class="title">Step 5: Replace Pseudocode with real code.</p>
                                                <p>Replace each line of your pseudocode into real code in the language you are working on.</p>
                                                <p>If you have divided your problem into subproblems then write down the code for each subproblem.</p>
                                                <p>While writing the code keep in mind three thingsâ€¦</p>
                                                <ul>
                                                        <li>The point where you started</li>
                                                        <li>Where you are right now</li>
                                                        <li>What is your destination (end result)</>
                                                </ul>
                                                <p class="title">Step 6: Simplify and optimize your code</p>
                                                <p>Always try to improve your code.</p>
                                                <p>Look back, analyze it once again and try to find a better alternate solution which is more effiient than the previous one.</p>
                                                <p>Writing the correct solution to your problem is not the final thing you should do. Explore the problem completely with all possible solutions and then write down the most efficient or optimized solution for your code.</p>
                                                <p>So once you are done with writing the solution for your code below are some questions you should ask yourself:</p>
                                                <ul>
                                                        <li>Does this code run for every possible input including the edge cases.</li>
                                                        <li>Is there an alternate solution for the same problem?</li>
                                                        <li>Is the code efficient? Can it be more efficient or can the performance be improved?</li>
                                                        <li>How else can you make the code more readable?</li>
                                                        <li>Are there any more extra steps or functions you can take out?</li>
                                                        <li>Is there any repetition in your code? Take it out.</li>
                                                </ul>

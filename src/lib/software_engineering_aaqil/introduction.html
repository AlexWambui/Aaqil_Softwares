                <h2 class="_heading2">What is it?</h2>
                <p>Software Engineering is not the same as web development.</p>
                <p>Software Engineering is the process of designing and building computer programs [operating systems, mobile apps and websites] and systems. It involves writing code, testing and debugging software, and maintaining and updating it over time.</p>
                <p>In simple terms, Software engineering is all about using computers and code to build useful and fun things people can use.</p>                
                <p>A good example is when you want to build a computer game. You need to come up with the idea for the game, plan out how it will work, use a programming language to write the code that will make the game run. Once the game is finished, you would need to test it to make sure it's working correctly. If you find any problems, you would need to go back and fix them by updating the code.</p>
                <p>Large software companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft view software engineering as different from web development. For example, Amazon has Frontend Engineers (FEE) and Software Development Engineers (SDE). </p>
                <p>Large companies require computer science knowledge for software development / engineering roles.</p>
                <p class="note_better">some of the things you should know are: stack and heap, Big-O notations, trees, how to traverse a graph, coding a sorting algorith, building your own data structures, managing memory, multidimensional arrays, associative arrays.</p>

                <h2 class="_heading2">Requirements</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>A little experience with coding (variables, loops, methods / functions, etc)</li>
                    <li>Good problem solving skills.</li>
                    <li>Strong analytical and technical skills.</li>
                    <li>Patience</li>

                <h2 class="_heading2">How to become a software Engineer</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Learn computer science and software engineering topics such as algorithms, data structures, computer organizations and programming languages. It's advisable to get certified as some organization would require you to be.</li>
                    <li>Gain practical experience through internships, co-op programs or by participating in hackathons and coding challenges.</li>
                    <li>Develop your skills by taking online courses, reading technical blogs and articles and participating in professional development opportunities.</li>

            <div class="container">
                <p>Why is community so important:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The network - helps you get to know people, engage with them and learn with them and from them.</li>
                    <li>The empowered journey - community empowers you to lead your learning journey. With the internet and the availability of learning assets, you no longer need a "sage on stage" to learn new skills and concepts. Own your learning.</li>
                    <li>Accountability - a community holds each other accountable. Solo online learning can be intimidating and hard to sustain without a proper support system. With a community, you get to share assets, regularly support each other, reach out for help, and provide feedback to one another.</li>

                <p>The most difficult thing you have to do everyday is to keep going despite the naysayers and no one believing in you.</p>

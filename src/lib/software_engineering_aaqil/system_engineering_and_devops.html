                <div class="concept_explanation" id="the_shell">
                    <h3 class="_heading3">The shell</h3>
                    <p>the shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating
                        system to perform.</p>
                    <p>in old days, it was the only user interface on Unix systems such as Linux.</p>
                    <p>Nowadays we have GUIs and CLIs such as the shell.</p>
                    <p>on most linux systems, a program called bash (Bourne Again Shell) - an enhanced version of the
                        original Unix shell program, sh, written by Steve Bourne - acts as the shell program.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="concept_explanation" id="shell_commands">
                    <h3 class="_heading3">Shell Commands</h3>
                    <h4 class="_heading4">Navigation</h4>
                    <p class="title">pwd</p>
                    <p>Since the command line interface cannot provide graphic pictures of the file system structure, we
                        must have a different way of representing it. To do this, think of the file system tree as a
                        maze, and that we are standing in it. At any given moment, we are located in a single directory.
                        Inside that directory, we can see its files and the pathway to its parent directory and the
                        pathways to the subdirectories of the directory in which we are standing.</p>
                    <p>The directory we are standing in is called the working directory.</p>
                    <p>To see the name of the working directory, we use the pwd command.</p>
                    <p class="command">pwd</p>

                    <p class="title">ls</p>
                    <p>When we first log on to our Linux system, the working directory is set to our home directory.
                        This is where we put our files. On most systems, the home directory will be called
                        /home/user_name, but it can be anything according to the whims of the system administrator.</p>
                    <p>To list the files in the working directory, we use the ls command.</p>
                    <p class="command">ls</p>
                    <p class="command">ls</p>
                    <p>ls can be used with different options:</p>
                    <p>list file in a specified directory</p>
                    <p class="command">ls /dir_part</p>
                    <p>list files in the working directory in long format</p>
                    <p class="command">ls -l</p>
                    <p>list all files (including hidden files) in the parent of the working directory in long format</p>
                    <p class="command">ls -la</p>

                    <p class="title">cd</p>
                    <p>To change the working directory (where we are standing in the maze) we use the cd command. To do
                        this, we type cd followed by the pathname of the desired working directory. </p>
                    <p>A pathname is the route we take along the branches of the tree to get to the directory we want.
                        Pathnames can be specified two different ways; absolute pathnames or relative pathnames.</p>
                    <p class="title">absolute pathname</p>
                    <p>An absolute pathname begins with the root directory and follows the tree branch by branch until
                        the path to the desired directory or file is completed. For example, there is a directory on
                        your system in which most programs are installed. The pathname of the directory is /usr/bin.
                        This means from the root directory (represented by the leading slash in the pathname) there is a
                        directory called "usr" which contains a directory called "bin".</p>
                    <p>example</p>
                    <p class="command">cd /usr/bin</p>
                    <p class="title">relative pathname</p>
                    <p>starts from the working directory. To do this, it uses a couple of special notations to represent
                        relative positions in the file system tree. These special notations are "." (dot) and ".." (dot
                        dot).</p>
                    <p>The "." notation refers to the working directory itself and the ".." notation refers to the
                        working directory's parent directory.</p>
                    <p class="note_better">If we type cd followed by nothing, cd will change the working directory to our home
                        directory.</p>
                    <p class="note_better">A related shortcut is to type cd ~user_name. In this case, cd will change the
                        working directory to the home directory of the specified user.</p>
                    <p class="note_better">Typing cd - changes the working directory to the previous one.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="concept_explanation" id="shebang">
                    <h3 class="_heading3">Shebang</h3>
                    <p>In computing, a shebang is the character sequence consisting of the characters number sign and
                        exclamation mark (#!) at the beginning of a script.</p>
                    <p>It is also called sha-bang (supposed to be misheard or confused by the author in his relatively
                        recent book, post 2010), hashbang, pound-bang, or hash-pling.</p>
                    <p>When a text file with a shebang is used as if it is an executable in a Unix-like operating
                        system, the program loader mechanism parses the rest of the file's initial line as an
                        interpreter directive. The loader executes the specified interpreter program, passing to it as
                        an argument the path that was initially used when attempting to run the script, so that the
                        program may use the file as input data.[8] For example, if a script is named with the path
                        path/to/script, and it starts with the following line, #!/bin/sh, then the program loader is
                        instructed to run the program /bin/sh, passing path/to/script as the first argument. In Linux,
                        this behavior is the result of both kernel and user-space code.</p>
                    <p>The shebang line is usually ignored by the interpreter, because the "#" character is a comment
                        marker in many scripting languages; some language interpreters that do not use the hash mark to
                        begin comments still may ignore the shebang line in recognition of its purpose.</p>

                    <h4 class="_heading4">Shebang lines</h4>

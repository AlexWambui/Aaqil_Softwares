            <h1 class="_heading1">Introduction</h1>
            <div class="container">
                <p>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language developed by Guido Van Rossum of the Netherlands in the 1990s.</p>
                <p>Python was inteded to be simple, intuitive language that is as powerful as traditional languages.</p>                
                <p>Python's simple syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpretted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.</p>         
                <p>Guido named the language Python because he was a big fan of "Monty Python's Flying Circus".</p>
                <p>Python lets you develop programs in less time and with less code than other programming languages.</p>
                <p>Python 2 became available in the year 2000 and it's not forward compatible (means it can't run most programs written in python 3).</p>
                <p>Python 3 was introduced in 2008 and it's not backward compatible (means it can't run most programs written in python 2).</p>

                <h2 class="_heading2">Why python is a great language</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Python has a simple syntax that's easier to read and use than most other languages.</li>
                    <li>Python has most of the features of traditional programming langugages. As a result, you can use Python to learn the concepts and skills that apply to those languages too.</li>
                    <li>Python supports the development of a wide range of programs, including games, web applications and system administration.</li>
                    <li>Python is used by many successful companies including: Google, IBM, Disney and EA GAmes.</li>
                    <li>Pyton is open source, meaning its source code is available to the entire Python Community.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="_heading2">Types of Python Applications</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Console Application - is a desktop application that uses the console to interact with the user. In this type, you enter commands at the command prompt in the console available from your operating sytem. A console applicaiton being run on windows system uses the command prompt and on a Mac OS X system a console application runs in the Terminal Window.</li>
                    <li>GUI Applicaiton - a GUI application performs the same tasks as the console application. It gets the same input from from the user, performs the same calculations, and displays the same results. However, GUI applications are more user-friendly and intuitive.</li>
                    <li>Web Applicaiton - can be called by a web browser running on a computer or mobile device and can use a server to process or store data. A web application performs the same task as the console and GUI applications. Python frameworks such as Flask and Django can help with development of web applications.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>You can also use python as a scripting language to work with other software applications or to develop system administration programs that perform tasks like automatically backing up a server or rotating log files. Programs like this usually don't have a user interface since they run in the background.</p>

                <h2 class="_heading2">Software needed</h2>
                <p>To develop python programs, you just need to download and install Python.</p>
                <p>It includes an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) called IDLE that you can use for coding, testing and debugging your programs.</p>

                <h2 class="_heading2">Coding Statement</h2>
                <p>Unlike many programming lanauges, the indentation of each line matters in a Python program. Incorrect indentation causes an error.</p>
                <p>In Python, the indentation is typically four spaces.</p>
                <p>In some cases, you'll want to divide a long statement over two or more lines. Then, you can use implicit continuation. To do that, you divide a statement before or after an operator like a plus or minus sign.</p>
                <p>Example of implicit continutaion:</p>
                <div class="container code Python_code">
                    <pre class="line-numbers">
                        <code class="language-python">
                            print("Total Score: " + str(score_total)
                                + "\nAverage Score: " + str(average_score))
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </div>
                <p>The other way to continue a statement is to use explicit continuation. Then, you code a backslash to show that a line is continued. In general, this is discouraged and isn't usually required.</p>
                <p>Example of explicit continuation:</p>
                <div class="container code Python_code">
                    <pre class="line-numbers">
                        <code class="language-python">
                            print("Total Score: " + str(score_total) \
                                + "\nAverage Score: " + str(average_score))
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </div>
                <p>The first line in a Python program is usually a shebang line.(#!/usr/bin/env Python3).</p>
                <p>The line is ignored by Windows, but Unix-like systems, use this line to determine what interpretter to use to run the program.</p>
                <h3 class="_heading3">First Program</h3>

                    <pre class="line-numbers">

                            counter = 0
                            score_total = 0

                            while test_score != 999:
                                test_score = int(input("Enter test score: "))
                                if test_score >= 0 and test_score <= 100:
                                    score_total += test_score
                                    counter += 1

                            average_score = round(score_total / counter)

                            print("Total Score: " + str(score_total))
                            print("Average Score: " + str(average_score))

            <div class="container">
                <p>Pycodestyle is a tool to check your Python code against some of the style conventions in PEP8.</p>
                <p>The package used to be called pep8 but was renamed to pycodestyle to reduce confussion.</p>

                <h2 class="_heading2">Installation</h2>
                <p>You can install, upgrade and unistall pycodestyle.py using the commands:</p>
                <p class="command">pip install pycodestyle</p>
                <p class="command">pip install --upgrade pycodestyle</p>
                <p class="command">pip uninstall pycodestyle</p>
                <p>Example of usage:</p>
                <p class="command">pycodestyle --first optparse.py</p>
                <p>To make pycodestyle show the source code for each error, and even the relevant text from PEP8:</p>
                <p class="command">pycodestyle --show-source --show-pep8 testsuite/E40.py</p>
                <p>To display how often each error was found:</p>

        <section class="container" id="comments">
            <h1 class="_heading1">Comments</h1>
            <div class="container">
                <p>Comments are usually ignored by the Python interpreter and thus have no effect on the operation of the program.</p>
                <p>Use comments to describe portions of code that are hard to understand, but don't overdo them.</p>
                <p>To comment, both inline and block comments, start with the # sign.</p>
                <p>Multi line comments can also be written using ''' Comment here '''</p>
                <p>Example of comments in python:</p>
                <div class="container code Python_code">
                    <pre class="line-numbers">

                            '''
                            This is another way to write multi line comments

                <p>These statements include if statemensts as well as looping statements.</p>
                <p>Before learning control statements, it's important to understand boolean expressions.</p>

                <h2 class="_heading2">Boolean Expressions</h2>
                <p>Boolean expressions are expressions that evaluate to either True or False based on a comparison between two or more values and that value can be assigned to a variable.</p>
                <p>When coding boolean expressions, be sure to compare numbers with numbers and strings with strings. Mixed expressions like comparing numbers with strings won't work the way you expect them to.</p>
                <p>You can also assign True or False to variables.</p>

                <p>Understand why you're learning python.</p>
                <p>Figure out how you learn best - is it through books, video tutorials or is it both methods.</p>
                <p>So the methods to learn python include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Learn the fundamentals - this includes: variables, operators, control flow (conditional statements), functions, data types, loops.</li>
                    <li>Once done with the fundamentals, start to learn Object Oriented Programming with Python. This includes: how to; create a class, create an instance variable, use methods, inheritance.</li>
                    <li>Data Structures - help build problem solving skills especially for projects. These include: stack, linked lists, trees. Also used in coding interviews to see how you solve problems.</li>
                    <li>Learn to solve problems - figure out how to break it down into small parts. Problem solving helps you build a way of thinking.</li>
                    <li>Join a community - find people on the same journey as you and connect with them. Give each other pointers to grow. You can join the pythonistacafe community.</li>
                    <li>Share you knowledge with others as you're learning - this helps you understand concepts you're trying to teach. You can start a Youtube channel or a blog. Explain to other people to help you know what you understand and what you don't.</li>
                    <li>Contribute to open source projects as you get better at python - projects include: tensorflow, flask, django, keras, youtube-dl, face-recognition, Ansible, httpie, pandas, scikit-learn.</li>
                    <li>Learn git and improve you git work flow.</li>
                    <li>Learn python frameworks like flask or django.</li>

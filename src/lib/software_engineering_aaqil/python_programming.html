            <div class="container">
                <p>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language developed by Guido Van Rossum of the Netherlands in the 1990s.</p>
                <p>Python was inteded to be simple, intuitive language that is as powerful as traditional languages.</p>                
                <p>Python's simple syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpretted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.</p>         
                <p>Guido named the language Python because he was a big fan of "Monty Python's Flying Circus".</p>
                <p>Python lets you develop programs in less time and with less code than other programming languages.</p>
                <p>Python 2 became available in the year 2000 and it's not forward compatible (means it can't run most programs written in python 3).</p>
                <p>Python 3 was introduced in 2008 and it's not backward compatible (means it can't run most programs written in python 2).</p>

                <h2 class="_heading2">Why python is a great language</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Python has a simple syntax that's easier to read and use than most other languages.</li>
                    <li>Python has most of the features of traditional programming langugages. As a result, you can use Python to learn the concepts and skills that apply to those languages too.</li>
                    <li>Python supports the development of a wide range of programs, including games, web applications and system administration.</li>
                    <li>Python is used by many successful companies including: Google, IBM, Disney and EA GAmes.</li>
                    <li>Pyton is open source, meaning its source code is available to the entire Python Community.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="_heading2">Types of Python Applications</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Console Application - is a desktop application that uses the console to interact with the user. In this type, you enter commands at the command prompt in the console available from your operating sytem. A console applicaiton being run on windows system uses the command prompt and on a Mac OS X system a console application runs in the Terminal Window.</li>
                    <li>GUI Applicaiton - a GUI application performs the same tasks as the console application. It gets the same input from from the user, performs the same calculations, and displays the same results. However, GUI applications are more user-friendly and intuitive.</li>
                    <li>Web Applicaiton - can be called by a web browser running on a computer or mobile device and can use a server to process or store data. A web application performs the same task as the console and GUI applications. Python frameworks such as Flask and Django can help with development of web applications.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>You can also use python as a scripting language to work with other software applications or to develop system administration programs that perform tasks like automatically backing up a server or rotating log files. Programs like this usually don't have a user interface since they run in the background.</p>

                <h2 class="_heading2">Software needed</h2>
                <p>To develop python programs, you just need to download and install Python.</p>
                <p>It includes an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) called IDLE that you can use for coding, testing and debugging your programs.</p>

                <h2 class="_heading2">Coding Statement</h2>
                <p>Unlike many programming lanauges, the indentation of each line matters in a Python program. Incorrect indentation causes an error.</p>
                <p>In Python, the indentation is typically four spaces.</p>
                <p>In some cases, you'll want to divide a long statement over two or more lines. Then, you can use implicit continuation. To do that, you divide a statement before or after an operator like a plus or minus sign.</p>
                <p>Example of implicit continutaion:</p>
                <div class="container code Python_code">
                    <pre class="line-numbers">
                        <code class="language-python">
                            print("Total Score: " + str(score_total)
                                + "\nAverage Score: " + str(average_score))
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </div>
                <p>The other way to continue a statement is to use explicit continuation. Then, you code a backslash to show that a line is continued. In general, this is discouraged and isn't usually required.</p>
                <p>Example of explicit continuation:</p>
                <div class="container code Python_code">
                    <pre class="line-numbers">
                        <code class="language-python">
                            print("Total Score: " + str(score_total) \
                                + "\nAverage Score: " + str(average_score))
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </div>
                <p>The first line in a Python program is usually a shebang line.(#!/usr/bin/env Python3).</p>
                <p>The line is ignored by Windows, but Unix-like systems, use this line to determine what interpretter to use to run the program.</p>
                <h3 class="_heading3">First Program</h3>

                            average_score = round(score_total / counter)

                <p>Pycodestyle is a tool to check your Python code against some of the style conventions in PEP8.</p>
                <p>The package used to be called pep8 but was renamed to pycodestyle to reduce confussion.</p>

                <h2 class="_heading2">Installation</h2>
                <p>You can install, upgrade and unistall pycodestyle.py using the commands:</p>
                <p class="command">pip install pycodestyle</p>
                <p class="command">pip install --upgrade pycodestyle</p>
                <p class="command">pip uninstall pycodestyle</p>
                <p>Example of usage:</p>
                <p class="command">pycodestyle --first optparse.py</p>
                <p>To make pycodestyle show the source code for each error, and even the relevant text from PEP8:</p>
                <p class="command">pycodestyle --show-source --show-pep8 testsuite/E40.py</p>
                <p>To display how often each error was found:</p>

            <div class="container">
                <p>Comments are usually ignored by the Python interpreter and thus have no effect on the operation of the program.</p>
                <p>Use comments to describe portions of code that are hard to understand, but don't overdo them.</p>
                <p>To comment, both inline and block comments, start with the # sign.</p>
                <p>Multi line comments can also be written using ''' Comment here '''</p>
                <p>Example of comments in python:</p>
                <div class="container code Python_code">
                    <pre class="line-numbers">

                            '''
                            This is another way to write multi line comments

                            It's mostly used to document your code.

                <p>The for statement in python differs a bit from C or Pascal. Rather than always iterating over an arithmetic progression of numbers (like in Pascal) or giving the iteration step and halting condition (as C), python's for statement iterates over the items of any sequence (a list or string), in the order they appear in the sequence.</p>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <div class="container code">
                    <pre class="line-numbers">
                        <code class="language-python">
                            # measure some strings:
                            words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenstrate']
                            for w in words:
                                print(w, len(w))
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </div>

                <h2 class="_heading2">range() function</h2>
                <p>If you need to iterate over a sequence of numbers, the built-in function range() comes in handy.</p>
                <p>It generates arithmetic progressions.</p>
                <div class="container code">
                    <pre class="line-numbers">
                        <code class="language-python">
                            for i in range(5):
                                print(i)
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </div>
                <p>The given end point (5) is never part of the generated sequence.</p>
                <p>range(10) would generate 10 values, the legal indices for items of a sequence of length 10.</p>
                <p>It is possible to let the range start at another number, or to specify a different increment (even negative; sometimes this is called the 'step').</p>
                <div class="container code">

                <h2 class="_heading2">Creating a function</h2>
                <p>to create a function, we use the keyword def, followed by the function name, parenthesis and any arguments required inside the parenthesis.</p>

                                To solve this, we can use named arguments instead to call the function.

        <section class="container" id="modules">
            <h1 class="_heading1">Modules</h1>
            <div class="container">
                <p>A module is a file that can contains reusable code like Python definitions, executable statements as well as fuctions.</p>
                <p>The file name is the module name with the suffix.py appended.</p>
                <p>As a program gets longer, you may want to split it into several files for easier maintenance.</p>
                <p>You may also want to use a handy function you've written in several programs without copying its definition into each program.</p>
                <p>Python has a way to put definitions in a file and use them in a script or in an interactive instace of the interpreter. Such a file is called a module.</p>
                <p>Definitions from a module can be imported into other modules or into the main module (the collection of variables that you have access to in a script executed at the top level and in calculator mode).</p>
                <p>Within a module, the module's name (as a string) is available as the value of the global variable __name__.</p>
                <p>For instance, create a file called fibo.py and have the contents:</p>
                <div class="container code">
                    <pre class="line-numbers">
                        <code class="language-python">
                            # Fibonacci numbers module
                            def fib(n):
                                a, b = 0, 1
                                while a < n:
                                    print(a, end='')
                                    a, b = b, a + b
                                print()


                            def fib2(n):
                                result = []
                                a, b = 0, 1
                                while a < n:
                                    result.append(a)
                                    a, b = b, a + b
                                return result
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </div>
                <p>To import this module in the interpreter, we would use:</p>
                <p class="command">import fibo</p>
                <p>This does not add the names of the functions defined in fibo directly to the current namespace; it only adds the module name fibo there.</p>
                <p>Using the module name you can access the functions:</p>
                <p class="command">fibo.fib(1000)</p>
                <p>This will display: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987</p>
                <p class="command">fibo.fib2(100)</p>
                <p>This will display: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]</p>
                <p class="command">fibo.__name__</p>
                <p>This will display: 'fibo'</p>
                <p>Statements in a module are intended to initialize the module. They are executed only the first time the module name is encountered in an import statement. (They also run if the file is executed as a script.)</p>
                <p>Each module has its own private namespace, which is used as the global namespace by all functions defined in the module.</p>
                <p>Thus, the author of a module can use global variables in the module without worrying about accidental clashes with a user’s global variables. On the other hand, if you know what you are doing you can touch a module’s global variables with the same notation used to refer to its functions, modname.itemname.</p>

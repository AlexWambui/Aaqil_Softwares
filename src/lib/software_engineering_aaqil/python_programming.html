            <div class="container">
                <p>To get started we need to download and install Python. It includes an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) called IDLE that you can use for coding, testing and debugging your programs.<a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Download Python</a></p>                
                <p>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language developed by Guido Van Rossum of the Netherlands in the 1990s and was named after the BBC show "Monty Python's Flying Circus" because Guido was a big fan of the show.</p>
                <p>Python was inteded to be simple, intuitive language that is as powerful as traditional languages.</p>                
                <p>Python's simple syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpretted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms hence enabling you develop programs in less time and with less code than other programming languages.</p>

                <h2 class="_heading2">Types of Python</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>The official version of python is called Python or CPython. Python 2 became available in the year 2000 and it's not forward compatible (means it can't run most programs written in python 3). Python 3 was introduced in 2008 and it's not backward compatible (means it can't run most programs written in python 2).</li>
                    <li>Another popular distribution of Python is Anaconda which is mainly focused on data science.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2 class="_heading2">Properties of Python</h2>
                <p><b>It's an interpreted language.</b> - This means when you run it, an interpreter will parse python programs line by line basis, as compared to compiled languages like C or C++, where the compiler first compiles the program and then starts running. The difference is that interpreted languages are a little slow as compared to compiled languages.</p>
                <p><b>Python is also dynamically typed.</b> - It doesn't require you to define variable data types ahead of time. Python automatically infers the data type of the variable based on the type of value it contains.</p>
                <p><b>Python is strongly typed.</b> - PHP or JavaScript convert data of one type to another automatically. For example: In JavaScript, 1 + "2" - converts to a string and results to '12' which is a string. However, in Python automatic conversions are not allowed so 1 + "2" would produce an error.</p>

                <h2 class="_heading2">Why python is a great language</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Python has a simple syntax that's easier to read and use than most other languages.</li>
                    <li>Python has most of the features of traditional programming langugages. As a result, you can use Python to learn the concepts and skills that apply to those languages too.</li>
                    <li>Python supports the development of a wide range of programs, including games, web applications and system administration.</li>
                    <li>Python is used by many successful companies including: Google, IBM, Disney and EA GAmes.</li>
                    <li>Python is open source, meaning its source code is available to the entire Python Community.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="_heading2">What you can do with Python</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Console Applications - is a desktop application that uses the console to interact with the user. In this type, you enter commands at the command prompt in the console available from your operating sytem. A console applicaiton being run on windows system uses the command prompt and on a Mac OS X system a console application runs in the Terminal Window.</li>
                    <li>GUI Development - a GUI application performs the same tasks as the console application. It gets the same input from from the user, performs the same calculations, and displays the same results. However, GUI applications are more user-friendly and intuitive.</li>
                    <li>Web Application - can be called by a web browser running on a computer or mobile device and can use a server to process or store data. A web application performs the same task as the console and GUI applications. Python frameworks such as Flask and Django can help with development of web applications.</li>
                    <li>System Administration tasks or system administration programs that perform tasks like automatically backing up a server or rotating log files. Programs like this usually don't have a user interface since they run in the background.</li>
                    <li>Scrape data from websites.</li>
                    <li>Financial Calculation.</li>
                    <li>Data Analysis.</li>
                    <li>Data Science.</li>
                    <li>Game Development.</li>
                    <li>Visualization.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="_heading2">Coding Statement</h2>
                <p>Unlike many programming langauges, the indentation of each line matters in a Python program. Incorrect indentation causes an error.</p>
                <p>In Python, the indentation is typically four spaces.</p>
                <p>In some cases, you'll want to divide a long statement over two or more lines. Then, you can use implicit continuation. To do that, you divide a statement before or after an operator like a plus or minus sign.</p>
                <p>Example of implicit continutaion:</p>
                <div class="container code Python_code">
                    <pre class="line-numbers">
                        <code class="language-python">
                            print("Total Score: " + str(score_total)
                                + "\nAverage Score: " + str(average_score))
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </div>
                <p>The other way to continue a statement is to use explicit continuation. Then, you code a backslash to show that a line is continued. In general, this is discouraged and isn't usually required.</p>
                <p>Example of explicit continuation:</p>
                <div class="container code Python_code">
                    <pre class="line-numbers">
                        <code class="language-python">
                            print("Total Score: " + str(score_total) \
                                + "\nAverage Score: " + str(average_score))
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </div>
                <p>The first line in a Python program is usually a shebang line.(#!/usr/bin/python3).</p>
                <p>The line is ignored by Windows, but Unix-like systems, use this line to determine what interpretter to use to run the program.</p>

                                test_score = int(input("Enter test score: "))
                                if test_score >= 0 and test_score <= 100:
                                    score_total += test_score

                            average_score = round(score_total / counter)

                            print("Total Score: " + str(score_total))
                            print("Average Score: " + str(average_score))

                <p>Comments are usually ignored by the Python interpreter and thus have no effect on the operation of the program.</p>
                <p>Use comments to describe portions of code that are hard to understand, or the purpose of the program but don't overdo them.</p>
                <p>In python, any line that start with the sign (#), is considered to be a comment.</p>                
                <p>Types of comments in python:</p>

            <h1 class="_heading1">Variables</h1>
            <div class="container">
                <p>Variables are named locations used to store references to the object stored in memory.</p>
                <p>Names we choose for variables and functions are commonly known as identifiers.</p>
                <p>In python, rules for identifiers are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>All identifiers must start with a letter or underscore (_), you can't use digits.</li>
                    <li>Identifiers can contain letter, digits and underscores(_). $, # are not allowed.</li>
                    <li>Identifiers can be of any length.</li>
                    <li>Identifiers can't be a keyword. Keywords are reserved words that python uses for special purposes. Keywords in pythons include:(false, none, true, and, as, pass, break, class, continue, def, del, elif, else, except, finally, for, from, global, if, import, in, is, lambda, nonlocal, not, or, assert, raise, return, try, while, with, yield).</li>
                </ol>
                <h3 class="_heading3">Assigning values to variables</h3>
                <p>To assign a value to a variable, equal sign (also known as the assignment operator (=)) is used.</p>
                <p>Values are basic things that programs work with. In programming, they are also known as literals.</p>
                <p>literals can be of different types: int (1, 11), float (3.14), string ("hello").</p>
                <p>in python, everything is an object even basic data types like int, float, string.</p>                
                <div class="note">
                    <p>When a value is assigned to a variable, the variable doesn't store the value itself. Instead,
                            the variable only stores a reference (address) of the object where it is stored in the
                            memory.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, x = 100, stores a reference (or address) to the 100 (an int object). The variable x doesn't store the object 100 itself.</p>
                </div>
                <p>To assign values to variables:</p>
                <div class="container code Python_code">

                            a = b = c = 100 # this assigns 100 to c, b and a.

                <p>simple positional formatting is the most common use-case and should be used if the order of arguments is not likely to change and only have very few elements to concatenate.</p>
                <p>since elements are represented by something as descriptive as a name, this simple style should only be used to format a relatively small number of elements.</p>
                <p>Example1:</p>
                <p>>'{} {}'.format('one', 'two')</p>
                <p>Example2:</p>
                <p>>'{} {}'.format(1, 2)</p>

                <h4 class="_heading4">Value Conversion</h4>
                <p>the new-style formatter calls by default the _format_() method of an object for its representation.</p>
                <p>if to render the output of str(...) or repr(...), use !s or !r conversion flags.</p>
                <p>in %-style you usually use %s for the string representation but there is %r for a repr(...) conversion.</p>

                    <p>by default values are formatted to take up only as much characters as needed to represent the content. It is however also possible to define that a value should be padded to a specific length.</p>
                    <p>to align right:</p>
                    <p>>'{:>10}'.format('test')</p>

                    <p>>'{:10}'.format('test')</p>
                    <p>using a padding character:</p>
                    <p>>'{:_<10}'.format('test')</p>
                    <p>center align values:</p>
                    <p>>'{:^10}'.format('test')</p>
                    <p>When using center alignment where the length of the string leads to an uneven split of the
                        padding characters, the extra character will be placed on the right side:</p>
                    <p>>'{:^6}'.format('zip')</p>

                    <h4 class="_heading4">Truncating long strings</h4>
                    <p>Inverse to padding it is also possible to truncate overly long values to a specific number of
                        characters.</p>
                    <p>The number after a (.) in the format specifies the precision of the output. For strings that
                        means that the output is truncated to the specified length. In our example this would be 5
                        characters.</p>

                <p>Boolean expressions are expressions that evaluate to either True or False based on a comparison between two or more values and that value can be assigned to a variable.</p>
                <p>When coding boolean expressions, be sure to compare numbers with numbers and strings with strings. Mixed expressions like comparing numbers with strings won't work the way you expect them to.</p>

                <p>The for statement in python differs a bit from C or Pascal. Rather than always iterating over an arithmetic progression of numbers (like in Pascal) or giving the iteration step and halting condition (as C), python's for statement iterates over the items of any sequence (a list or string), in the order they appear in the sequence.</p>

                <p>As a program gets longer, you may want to split it into several files for easier maintenance.</p>

                <p>Python has a way to put definitions in a file and use them in a script or in an interactive instace of the interpreter. Such a file is called a module.</p>
                <p>Definitions from a module can be imported into other modules or into the main module (the collection of variables that you have access to in a script executed at the top level and in calculator mode).</p>
                <p>Within a module, the module's name (as a string) is available as the value of the global variable __name__.</p>

                <p>To import this module in the interpreter, we would use:</p>
                <p class="command">import fibo</p>
                <p>This does not add the names of the functions defined in fibo directly to the current namespace; it only adds the module name fibo there.</p>
                <p>Using the module name you can access the functions:</p>
                <p class="command">fibo.fib(1000)</p>
                <p>This will display: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987</p>
                <p class="command">fibo.fib2(100)</p>
                <p>This will display: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]</p>
                <p class="command">fibo.__name__</p>
                <p>This will display: 'fibo'</p>
                <p>Statements in a module are intended to initialize the module. They are executed only the first time the module name is encountered in an import statement. (They also run if the file is executed as a script.)</p>
                <p>Each module has its own private namespace, which is used as the global namespace by all functions defined in the module.</p>
                <p>Thus, the author of a module can use global variables in the module without worrying about accidental clashes with a user’s global variables. On the other hand, if you know what you are doing you can touch a module’s global variables with the same notation used to refer to its functions, modname.itemname.</p>

                <p>Understand why you're learning python.</p>
                <p>Figure out how you learn best - is it through books, video tutorials or is it both methods.</p>
                <p>So the methods to learn python include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Learn the fundamentals - this includes: variables, operators, control flow (conditional statements), functions, data types, loops.</li>
                    <li>Once done with the fundamentals, start to learn Object Oriented Programming with Python. This includes: how to; create a class, create an instance variable, use methods, inheritance.</li>
                    <li>Data Structures - help build problem solving skills especially for projects. These include: stack, linked lists, trees. Also used in coding interviews to see how you solve problems.</li>
                    <li>Learn to solve problems - figure out how to break it down into small parts. Problem solving helps you build a way of thinking.</li>
                    <li>Join a community - find people on the same journey as you and connect with them. Give each other pointers to grow. You can join the pythonistacafe community.</li>
                    <li>Share you knowledge with others as you're learning - this helps you understand concepts you're trying to teach. You can start a Youtube channel or a blog. Explain to other people to help you know what you understand and what you don't.</li>
                    <li>Contribute to open source projects as you get better at python - projects include: tensorflow, flask, django, keras, youtube-dl, face-recognition, Ansible, httpie, pandas, scikit-learn.</li>
                    <li>Learn git and improve you git work flow.</li>
                    <li>Learn python frameworks like flask or django.</li>

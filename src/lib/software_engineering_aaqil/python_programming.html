                    <h3 class="_heading3">Introduction to python</h3>
                    <p>python is a general-purpose programming language created by Guido Van Rossum.</p>
                    <p>python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language.</p>
                    <p>Python is an interpreted language. </p>
                    <p>it has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to
                        object-oriented programming.</p>
                    <p>Python's elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an
                        ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most
                        platforms.</p>
                    <p>with python you can do:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>GUI development</li>
                        <li>Web application</li>
                        <li>scrape data from websites</li>
                        <li>System administration tasks</li>
                        <li>Financial Calculation</li>
                        <li>Data Analysis</li>
                        <li>Data Science</li>
                        <li>Game Development</li>
                        <li>Visualization</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="_heading3">Origin of the name Python</h3>
                    <p>the language is named after the BBC show "Monty Python's Flying Circus" and has nothing to do
                        with reptiles.</p>

                    <h3 class="_heading3">Language properties of Python</h3>
                    <p class="title">Python is an interpreted language</p>
                    <p>when you run python program, an interpreter will parse python program line by line basis, as
                        compared to compiled languages like C or C++, where the compiler first compiles the program and
                        then start running.</p>
                    <p>So what's the difference?</p>
                    <p>The difference is that interpreted languages are a little bit slow as compared to compiled
                        languages.</p>
                    <p>writing codes in compiled languages is a daunting task for a beginner.</p>
                    <p>Also in such languages, you need to write even most basic functions like calculate the length of
                        the array, split the string etc.</p>
                    <p>For more advanced tasks sometimes you need to create your own data structures to encapsulate data
                        in the program. So in C/C++ before you actually start solving your business problem you need to
                        take care of all minor details. This is where Python comes. In Python, you don't need to define
                        any data structure, no need to define small utility functions because Python has everything to
                        get you started.</p>
                    <p class="title">Python is dynamically typed</p>
                    <p>python doesn't require you to define variable data types ahead of time.</p>
                    <p>python automatically infers the data type of the variable based on the type of value it
                        contains.</p>

                    <p class="title">Python is strongly typed</p>
                    <p>PHP or Javascript, convert data of one type to another automatically.</p>
                    <p>For example: In JS, 1 + "2" - converts 1 to a string and concatenates to "2", which results to
                        '12' which is a string.</p>
                    <p>However, in python, such automatic conversions are not allowed.</p>
                    <p>so 1 + "2" would produce an error.</p>

                    <h3 class="_heading3">Types of Python</h3>
                    <p>The official version of python is called Python or CPython. <a href="https://www.python.org/">Download
                        official python</a></p>
                    <p>Another popular distribution of python is Anaconda. It's mainly focused on data science. <a
                            href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Download Anaconda Python</a></p>

                    <h3 class="_heading3">Running Python Programs</h3>
                    <p>Python uses a command-line tool called pip.</p>
                    <p>to run a program stored in a file:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Open the terminal and change current working dir to dir where the file is stored</li>
                        <li>to run the program, type the command:
                            <p class="command">python3 hello.py</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>alternatively you can make python programs runnable scripts by using these line at the beginning
                        of python scripts</p>
                    <p class="command">#!/usr/bin/python3</p>
                    <p>then making the scripts executable using</p>
                    <p class="command">chmod u+x file_name</p>

                    <h3 class="_heading3">Comments</h3>
                    <p>Comments are notes which describe the purpose of the program or how the program works.</p>
                    <p>Comments are not programming statements that Python interpreter executes while running the
                        program.</p>
                    <p>Comments can also be used to write program documentation.</p>
                    <p>In python, any line that begins with a pound sign (#) is considered a comment.</p>

                <p>Understand why you're learning python.</p>
                <p>Figure out how you learn best - is it through books, video tutorials or is it both methods.</p>
                <p>So the methods to learn python include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Learn the fundamentals - this includes: variables, operators, control flow (conditional statements), functions, data types, loops.</li>
                    <li>Once done with the fundamentals, start to learn Object Oriented Programming with Python. This includes: how to; create a class, create an instance variable, use methods, inheritance.</li>
                    <li>Data Structures - help build problem solving skills especially for projects. These include: stack, linked lists, trees. Also used in coding interviews to see how you solve problems.</li>
                    <li>Learn to solve problems - figure out how to break it down into small parts. Problem solving helps you build a way of thinking.</li>
                    <li>Join a community - find people on the same journey as you and connect with them. Give each other pointers to grow. You can join the pythonistacafe community.</li>
                    <li>Share you knowledge with others as you're learning - this helps you understand concepts you're trying to teach. You can start a Youtube channel or a blog. Explain to other people to help you know what you understand and what you don't.</li>
                    <li>Contribute to open source projects as you get better at python - projects include: tensorflow, flask, django, keras, youtube-dl, face-recognition, Ansible, httpie, pandas, scikit-learn.</li>
                    <li>Learn git and improve you git work flow.</li>
                    <li>Learn python frameworks like flask or django.</li>

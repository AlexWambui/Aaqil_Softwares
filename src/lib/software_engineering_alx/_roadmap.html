											<h2 class="text-dark _heading2">Objectives</h2>
											<h2>Background Context</h2>

											<p>
												The word “networking” elicits a variety of responses –
												excitement, dread, confusion, and more. Befriending
												strangers for career betterment can feel selfish,
												insincere, and difficult if you are doing it
												incorrectly.
											</p>

											<blockquote>
												<p><em>Networking is all about relationships.</em></p>
											</blockquote>

											<p>
												It is about mutually respecting others that share your
												interest.
											</p>

											<p>
												Don’t think of networking simply as the means to a job;
												it’s about investing into an industry community in such
												a way that makes it an industry you want to stay in.
											</p>

											<p>
												Collaborative. Teachable. Helpful. Giving. vs
												Egocentric. Withholding. Overbearing.
											</p>

											<p>
												As you network, be mindful of the traits you’re
												contributing to the tech industry.
											</p>

											<p>
												This project will explore how to develop appropriate and
												sustainable networking skills. Although everyone will
												develop their professional circles differently, there
												are some tried and true mentalities and habits that will
												benefit regardless of your needs.
											</p>

											<h3>Finding Direction</h3>

											<p>
												Networking should always begin with a committed, clear
												pursuit of your passion. If you don’t know what you
												love, or why you love it, you won’t know where to invest
												or which questions to ask.
											</p>

											<p>
												Especially in the beginning, you may not have a narrowed
												scope – and that’s ok – just continue to dig into what
												you enjoy. Focus on learning. Keep coding. Explore
												meetups. Over time, this digging will bring you
												understanding of how you’ll want to spend your time.
											</p>

											<p>
												A sense of direction will focus your energy, time, and
												resources. It will also inform how you request support
												from peers, school, and mentors.
											</p>

											<p>
												Let’s say you have a lot of interest in Machine
												Learning. Your initial instinct may be to find a mentor
												in that field, but that isn’t the best first step.
											</p>

											<ul>
												<li>
													You may not have a lot of [or any] field-specific
													understanding → Interaction will be awkward.
												</li>
												<li>
													Your questions won’t be well-defined, so they’ll be
													harder to answer → It will be disrespecting the
													mentor’s time/energy/expertise.
												</li>
												<li>
													You won’t be demonstrating a personal investment → you
													will damage your personal brand and your repertoire
													with that mentor.
												</li>
											</ul>

											<p>What is an alternative? Follow the framework!</p>

											<p>
												Start out exploring a topic through research, tutorials,
												trial/error, peers, TAs, and staff (aka The Framework);
												consider this great practice because when you attend a
												meetup, conference, or mentor lunch you will be putting
												your best foot forward. Once you have grappled with your
												interest and are presented with niche questions, get
												your feet wet and reach out to others in the industry.
											</p>

											<blockquote>
												<p>
													<em
														>Your networking should reflect the curiosities
														you’re personally cultivating; others will know how
														to better pursue opportunity with you if you place
														yourself within the appropriate circles</em
													>
												</p>
											</blockquote>

											<h3>Creating Connections</h3>

											<p>
												Developing professional relationships isn’t any
												different from what you’ve been doing at ALX – it’s just
												a new context for practicing the peer learning framework
												that begins right at school. There are a variety of life
												and professional backgrounds represented in each cohort.
												Some have already had experience working in tech, while
												others may soon find themselves in the job of their
												dreams.
											</p>

											<p>
												You never know where you - or someone you know - will be
												in 2, 5, or 10 years.
											</p>

											<p>
												The peer you help debug one afternoon may know of a
												great job lead in a few years (or months) when you are
												pursuing different opportunities. Make sure those you
												interact with remember you fondly.
											</p>

											<p>
												Building professional relationships is not just about
												what we get out of it today. It’s about a relationship
												of give and take over time. In the same way that
												friendships take time to develop mutual trust and
												respect, professional relationships require investment
												of energy and time. People want to know that your
												integrity, skill, and work ethic can be trusted. The
												more respect and empathy you bring into your new
												interactions, the more quickly trust develops.
											</p>

											<p>
												In short, if you care about another’s experience in tech
												and life - regardless of their seniority - they are more
												likely to respond with care to yours.
											</p>

											<p>
												You may be thinking, “I am a complete n00b - what do I
												have to offer?”. There are people all along the gradient
												of expertise. To your mentors, you can return gratitude
												and respect for knowledge time shared. You can also pass
												along whatever you&rsquo;ve learned to those getting
												into the industry! (To name a few ideas: write a
												technical tutorial, mentor a high school student, speak
												at a meetup about lessons learned, etc.)
											</p>

											<h3>Doing it Well</h3>

											<p>
												It isn’t enough to go through motions; it’s important to
												do the aforementioned appropriately. Oftentimes, you
												will only have moments to make a memorable impression,
												and you want to do all you can to ensure it’s a positive
												one. There are countless books entailing the nuances of
												social interactions - all of which you are welcome to
												read ;) - but here are some condensed tips.
											</p>

											<h3>Self-Respect</h3>

											<p>
												If you want respect from others, it starts with you. The
												integrity you put into your work and presentation will
												influence how much someone is willing to invest in you.
												You deserve to be represented by the side that a
												stranger will more quickly come to trust.
											</p>

											<p><strong>Work</strong></p>

											<ul>
												<li>Clean code</li>
												<li>Concise comments</li>
												<li>
													Descriptive / appropriate GitHub commit messages
												</li>
												<li>GitHub (real ReadMes, no temporary files, etc)</li>
												<li>Reputation as peer/coworker</li>
											</ul>

											<p><strong>Presentation</strong></p>

											<ul>
												<li>
													Dress for the job you want (if you’d wear it for
													basketball or yoga leave it at home)
												</li>
												<li>Posture</li>
												<li>Don’t use explicit language</li>
												<li>Smile - it breaks the ice on both sides</li>
											</ul>

											<h3>Other-Respect</h3>

											<p>
												No one owes you anything. Any advice, perspective,
												contact, swag, or conference ticket you are given is a
												bonus. Entitlement is an insult to others and a lethal
												blow to your reputation. Here are reminders on how to
												demonstrate respect towards others&hellip;
											</p>

											<ul>
												<li>
													Say “please” and “thank you” - it isn’t rocket
													science, but it goes a long way
												</li>
												<li>
													Follow up - after meeting/interview/advice session,
													thank them for their time
												</li>
												<li>
													Be aware of their surroundings - 30 people trying to
													speak with them? Perhaps, not the best time to talk at
													length about your life
												</li>
												<li>Don’t be late</li>
												<li>
													Don’t be late (nope, that isn’t a typo; it’s just that
													important)
												</li>
												<li>
													Listen more than you speak - you’ll be amazed at what
													you learn
												</li>
												<li>
													Don’t request hookups or referrals - it’s rude; if
													they want you to have it, they’ll give it
												</li>
												<li>
													For questions, follow the framework first so your
													interactions are respectful
												</li>
											</ul>

											<h3>Templates</h3>

											<p>
												It can be daunting to know how to best compose a
												message. Templates are helpful, but you want to
												personalize it otherwise it’ll seem disingenuine. Some
												key points to remember&hellip;
											</p>

											<ul>
												<li>
													Less is more - kindly get to the point, because people
													are busy. Moreover your lengthy email will be avoided
													out of sheer time/energy constraints
												</li>
												<li>
													Reference the connection - Did you talk about AWS at a
													conference? Meet through a mutual contact? Jog their
													memory with a well-framed detail.
												</li>
												<li>
													Respect their time - don’t bomb drop questions without
													first asking if they’ve the time/willingness to answer
													them (unless they earlier offered to do so)
												</li>
												<li>
													Offer to buy them coffee - if someone’s offered their
													in-person time to answer questions, at least
													compensate with a cup of their preferred beverage at a
													convenient location per their lifestyle.
												</li>
												<li>
													Let them propose their best availability - maybe you
													don’t like waking up early; if that’s their proposed
													time to meet, accommodate.
												</li>
											</ul>

													contact:</strong

											<h2>
												Should I Really Care About My Social Media Presence?
											</h2>

											<p>
												Social Media may not be everyone’s favorite thing, but
												it is definitely important to have a professional social
												media presence when looking for opportunities and
												throughout your professional career.
											</p>

											<p>
												A short list of reasons why a social media presence is
												important:
											</p>

											<ul>
												<li>Networking</li>
												<li>Engagement</li>
												<li>Getting your name out there</li>
												<li>Showing your personality</li>
												<li>Staying up to date</li>
											</ul>

											<p>
												Two social media platforms software engineers often use
												are Twitter and LinkedIn.
											</p>

											<h3>Twitter</h3>

											<p>
												Twitter is an instant sharing microblogging and social
												networking platform with persistent content and the
												ability to rapidly show different levels of
												agreement/engagement.
											</p>

											<p>
												Twitter has high use in Tech due to its persistent
												nature, rapid and broad sharing, and ability to easily
												share content that’s not on the Twitter network with
												outbound links.
											</p>

											<p>
												Content on Twitter tends to be both personal and
												professional, with the ratio leaning one way or the
												other depending on the individual user.
											</p>

											<p>
												Many students find success in engaging with people they
												respect and look up to in the software engineering world
												through thoughtful interactions via Twitter.
											</p>

											<h3>LinkedIn</h3>

											<p>
												LinkedIn is a professional networking platform which
												tends to have more professional content, as users are
												often looking for job opportunities, to hire talent, or
												to expand their network.
											</p>

											<p>
												Whether or not you’re employed, LinkedIn is a great
												platform to share articles, your own blog posts, and
												react to others posts. Conversations often happen in the
												comments of posts and unexpected connections happen!
											</p>

											<p>
												Many of our students find that posting on LinkedIn
												consistently is the key to getting engagement on the
												platform. Making it a goal to post a blog once a month
												is a sure way to get practice writing technically while
												also getting your name on people’s radars!
											</p>

											<h2>Branding for Coders</h2>

											<h3>What is a Brand?</h3>

											<p>A brand has 2 key parts:</p>

											<ul>
												<li>
													Emotional, instantaneous, conscious or unconscious
													reaction to thinking about a particular company or
													group

													<ul>
														<li>
															A Brand is a person’s gut feeling about a product,
															service or company
														</li>
														<li>
															It is not what you say it is, it is what they say
															it is
														</li>
													</ul>
												</li>
												<li>
													The distinct look, feel, and voice a company or group
													uses to reflect its identity and mission statement

													<ul>
														<li>
															OK brand - Visually consistent look and approach
														</li>
														<li>
															Fantastic brand - permeates everything, drives
															decisions, is the organization’s DNA, and becomes
															a brand promise to people internally and
															externally
														</li>
													</ul>
												</li>
											</ul>

											<h4>Example of Well-Known Brands</h4>

											<p>
												Viewing the images below, we know the companies they
												represent because of the brands they have built. Whether
												you like them or not, they usually invoke some sort of
												opinion and they strive to have consistent branding.
											</p>

											</p>

											<h3>What Brands Do I Have?</h3>

											<p>
												As a working individual, we usually have 2 main brands,
												a personal brand and a professional one. Both are
												important to keep balanced when thinking about your
												professional presence because they tend to overlap in
												the social media sphere.
											</p>

											<h4>Personal Brands</h4>

											<p>
												For personal brands, think about your core tenants and
												who you are after school/work or on the weekends. Take
												some time to answer the following questions:
											</p>

											<ul>
												<li>What makes you special?</li>
												<li>What do you have to share with the world?</li>
												<li>What excites you?</li>
												<li>
													How do you want to be known by close friends, online
													acquaintances, and complete strangers?
												</li>
											</ul>

											<p>
												The answers to these questions will help you shape the
												content you’d like to choose to share to create a
												consistent personal brand.
											</p>

											<p>
												When building a personal brand, it’s important to keep
												sharing to a fun, yet professional level. Similarly to
												how hiring managers may look at your commits to gauge
												professionalism, they will search for social media
												accounts to gauge your personality as well. This may not
												seem fair, but it is the reality we are in. With this in
												mind, whenever you post, even if it’s for your personal
												branch, think “would I want my future manager to see
												this?”
											</p>

											<h4>Professional Brands</h4>

											<p>
												Professional brands are those we have in relation to the
												work we do and/or the employers we have. Posting content
												related to your profession or current company will make
												you look more attractive to your current and future
												employers.
											</p>

											<p>
												While a student or looking for opportunities, a great
												way to build up a professional brand is to post articles
												related to the work you’d like to get into with a short
												comment on the article. See if you can engage your
												network with a call to action! Another way to boost your
												professionalism know-how is to write blogs and share
												them with your network. (Don’t forget to follow up on
												comments on your blogs to further engagement!)
											</p>

											<h5>A Word of Advice</h5>

											<p>
												When employed, always keep your employer’s brand in
												mind. The text “my opinions do not reflect those of my
												employer” in your social media bios will not save you if
												you post something that goes against your company’s Code
												of Conduct or other policies!
											</p>

											<h2>Profile Pics, Cover Images, and Bios - Oh My!</h2>

											<h3>Profile Pictures</h3>

											<p>
												Profile pictures, ideally, are a photo of yourself as
												humans are quicker at pictographic processing than
												textual processing. A good picture will become your icon
												and help with identifiability.
											</p>

											<p>
												When choosing a profile picture, think about your
												personal brand. Are you calm and professional? Outgoing
												and like outdoors? Love art or music? Pick a picture
												that works for you and makes you identifiable. Ask,
												“does this image reflect well on what makes me special”,
												and “if an employer saw this image, would they want to
												interview me?”.
											</p>

											<p>
												To get the best quality, you should use a high
												resolution image, at least 00400 pixels with a final
												size less than 2MB.
											</p>

											<h3>Cover Images</h3>

											<p>
												Use a cover image to show off your personality or
												something that’s important to you. You can have fun with
												this, but personal/professional brand rules still apply.
											</p>

											<p>
												An extra step to make is to thematically fit your cover
												image with your profile picture and/or personal bio.
											</p>

											<p>
												Sharp, high resolution photos matter here, so use high
												quality images.
											</p>

											<h3>Personal Bio</h3>

											<p>
												Personal Bios are a great way to share a taste of who
												you are and what your passions are. Your bio should
												reflect the content users should expect to see you
												sharing.
											</p>

											<h4>Do’s</h4>

											<ul>
												<li>
													For your display name, use your full name to help with
													discovery
												</li>
												<li>Use complete sentences</li>
												<li>Let your personality shine</li>
												<li>
													Share about what you do, or what you want to do,
													professionally
												</li>
												<li>
													Mention your school, or later your job, with their
													handle (eg: @holbertonschool on Twitter)
												</li>
												<li>Link to your github, portfolio site, or similar</li>
											</ul>

											<h4>Don’t’s</h4>

											<ul>
												<li>Leave the bio blank</li>
												<li>Leave the location blank</li>
												<li>Use bad language</li>
												<li>Make spelling mistakes</li>
											</ul>

						by Juma Allan - Think of your job as a hobby so you enjoy it and
						don't get tired of it.

					<p>
						SE Journey is really tough but the destination is amazing. So don't
						give up, take breaks instead.
					</p>
					<p>
						Build your skills and practice. Gateway is skillset and
						opportunities meet you.

					<p>SE is a product of small habits rather than a complete skeleton itself</p>
                    <p>Software Engineers are not born - They learn how to learn fast and hence able to bulldoze through these challenges.</p>
                    <p>SE requires lots of patience, perserverance, determination and grit.</p>

					<p>THE MORE SKILLS YOU ACQUIRE THE MORE CONFIDENT YOU BECOME.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Don't try to learn too fast - Real accomplishment is when you
							learn things with precisions. So it's more important to learn with
							perfection. The early stage is for learning the basics of the
							language as it sets the foundation (Variables, functions,
							conditions, loops, classes, objects).
						</li>
						<li>
							Don't learn things randomly - Focus on one thing at a time. Try to
							learn one thing at a time to ensure it sticks. Figure out a
							roadmap to follow. Go through a bootcamp. This helps to know what
							to learn and when to learn it.
						</li>
						<li>
							Don't just memorize - Coding is an applicable skill, not just a
							collection of abstract facts.
						</li>
						<li>
							Check up example codes - Best way of learning is self learning.
							Here you can also consult various text books where examples are
							provided.
						</li>
						<li>
							More and more practice - Practice makes perfect. The old school
							thought matches the conditions of programming.
						</li>
						<li>
							Learn using a debugger - This is more effective as it helps find
							possible chances or errors more easily.
						</li>
						<li>
							Be an active learner - Change your approach of learning. Online
							tutorials can help you follow methodical process. Don't just
							consume video tutorials. Try out things you learn on yourself
							without help.
						</li>
						<li>
							Innovate and build stuff - Learning is just the beginning. Jump in
							and do your best. Have tangible goals. Build your own projects as
							it helps you learn more. Build a portfolio to demonstrate your
							ability to code.
						</li>
						<li>
							Market - Put yourself out there. Build a Linkedin, message
							recruiters, apply for jobs, work with people, go for interviews.
						</li>

					<h1 class="_heading1">Sabotages to coding career</h1>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Trying to hide your mistakes - Tell your project manager or boss
							right away so they can inform clients or come up with game plans
							to fix it. Transparency is usually respected so speak out when you
							make mistakes so they can be corrected.
						</li>
						<li>
							Not asking for help - Ask for help even though it might be hard.
							Ask why solutions work when you get help so you know how to deal
							with the issue later.
						</li>
						<li>
							Being defensive and close-minded - Don't complain when you meet
							with challenges. Have an open and growth mindset. Deal with
							projects that are out of your comfort zone. Be a good team player
							and always to research.

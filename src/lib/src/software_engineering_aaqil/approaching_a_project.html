                                        <h2 class="_heading2">0. Read</h2>
					<p>Read everything pertinent to the project at hand (prerequisites, man pages, documentation, books and articles) then try out some examples.</p>

                                        <h2 class="_heading2">1. Think</h2>
                                        <p>Take a breath and think of the solution.</p>
                                        <p>Understand all the required concepts and algorithms before you proceed to solve tasks.</p>
                                        <p>Do not write any piece of code before you have the solution. Coding should only be translating your solution to computer code.</p>
                                        <p>To think of your solution, break things down; a big problem is easier to solve when you break it into smaller, easier problems.</p>
                                        <p>Sometimes, you will be able to "guess" solutions or complete tasks without totally understandng all the concepts, especially if a task is very small. Do NOT do this, because if you do not develop your critical thinking skills with samller learning opportunities you will not have the ability to solve harder questions.</p>
                                        <p>Use a whiteboard or pen/paper untill you are 100% sure your code will work; this maintains focus, and keeps your mind active.</p>
                                        <p>Example:</p>
                                        <p>First rephrase the problem. "what am I trying to accomplish here?"</p>
                                        <p>Then go through different examples: "if I understand correctly, then with this input/ context/parameters I should output/print/return/draw/...this..." What could be the edge cases I have to think about to make sure my function/program will always work correctly and never crash?"</p>
                                        <p>Next, focus on the basic/regular use cases. "What should my algorithm be?"</p>
                                        <p>When you find it, try to run it through different examples on a whiteboard or pen/paper and see if the input/output match your expectations.</p>
                                        <p>Finally, try to see what changes you have to make to take care of all possible edge cases.</p>

                <p>The only way we can justify the privillige of having good health, education and influence  is by doing hard things that solve the world's greatest problems.</p>
                <p>Nelson Mandela, "Every now and then, a generation is called upon to be great. You can be that generation."</p>
                <p>The most difficult thing you have to do everyday is to keep going despite the naysayers and no one believing in you.</p>
                <p>Understand the immense potential tech has for transforming the world and solving grand challenges ranging from agriculture, energy, delivery of services from government to citizens and food security to access to quality education and healthcare.</p>
                <h2 class="_heading2">Requirements</h2>
                <ol>
                        <li>A little experience with coding (variables, loops, methods / functions, etc)</li>
                        <li>Patience</li>
                        <li>Time</li>
                </ol>
                <h2 class="_heading2">What is it?</h2>
                <p>Software Engineering is not the same as web development.</p>
                <p>Large software companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft view software engineering as different from web development. For example, Amazon has Frontend Engineers (FEE) and Software Development Engineers (SDE). </p>
                <p>Large companies require computer science knowledge for software development / engineering roles.</p>

                <p class="note_better">some of the things you should know are: stack and heap, Big-O notations, trees, how to traverse a graph, coding a sorting algorith, building your own data structures, managing memory, multidimensional arrays, associative arrays.</p>

                <h3 class="_heading3">Don't feel you aren't smart enough</h3>
                <p>successful software engineers are smart, but many have an insecurity that they are not smart enough.</p>

            <h1 class="_heading1">Community</h1>
            <div class="container">
                <p>Why is community so important:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The network - helps you get to know people, engage with them and learn with them and from them.</li>
                    <li>The empowered journey - community empowers you to lead your learning journey. With the internet and the availability of learning assets, you no longer need a "sage on stage" to learn new skills and concepts. Own your learning.</li>
                    <li>Accountability - a community holds each other accountable. Solo online learning can be intimidating and hard to sustain without a proper support system. With a community, you get to share assets, regularly support each other, reach out for help, and provide feedback to one another.</li>

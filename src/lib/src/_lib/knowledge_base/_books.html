            <p>By Jordan Peterson</p>
            <p>Instead of taking notes during a lecture, listen to the lecture then take notes after the lecture.</p>
            <p>This forces you to practice remembering</p>
            <p>For books read instead of reading and highlighting or underlining. Read a couple of paragraphs or an essay. Close the book and write down what you're thinking and what you remember to instantiate what you're reading into your memory and put at hand.</p>
            <p>Think through what you're reading. Relate it to other ideas and ask questions as you criticize that idea to make this recall (remembering something complex) rather than recognition.</p>
            <p>Separate out the function of reading and note taking. Read -> Think -> Write.</p>
            <p>Practice reflective writing as it promotes the brain's attentive focus, boosts long-term memory, illuminates patterns and gives the brain time for reflection.</p>
            <p>Read, reformulate to your own as if you are going to teach someone else then you'll understand it. This forces you to break down the concept into chunks you can understand better.</p>

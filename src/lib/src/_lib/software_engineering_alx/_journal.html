                <p>Tasks:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Setting the right goals because from testimonials, students with the right goals are the ones who succeed. The right goals include leveraging your skills and knowledge from the program to earn high income.</li>

                <p>You need others to succeed in the program so engage with the community and network.</p>        
                <p>ALX VALUES:</p>
                <ul>

                    <li>Humility: I see my effect on others. Serve others and larger purpose.</li>
                    <li>Adventure: I see living as a joy to share.</li>

                <p class="title">Admin matters</p>
                <p>Plagiarism is not allowed. Don't share solutions so you don't take away the opportunity for others to learn.</p>
                <p>Can only defer 3 times.</p>

                <p>Cohort 9 has over 60,000 people.</p>

                <p class="title">The room fellowship</p>
                <p>is a career accelerator to enter the job market.</p>
                <p>It's a place to connect and encourage each other to succeed.</p>
                <p>75% of job are never advertised and 80% of job are advertised by word of mouth so who you know is really important than what you know in finding a job.</p>
                <p>If you network well, you can find friendships for life here.</p>
                <p>Only successful ALX graduates can join the fellowship.</p>

                <p>Understanding the importance of whiteboarding which is like having the solution in form of flowcharts or pseudocodes. As a SE you need this since you're not restricted or only going to use one programming language.</p>

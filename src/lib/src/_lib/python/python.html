                    <h3 class="_heading3">Source Code Management</h3>
                    <p>allows a developer to organize code iterations chronologically, and version it for an
                        application.</p>
                    <p>most powerful features of source code management systems are in how they allow teams of very
                        diverse sizes to work together on the same application simultaneously.</p>
                    <p>some common terms include:</p>
                    <ul class="list-group">
                        <li>repository - a project will be called a repository, it's representing the index / the
                            filesystem root of your project.
                        </li>
                        <li>branches of the codebase, that will iterate on separately to other developers. For example a
                            branch can be used for a feature or a bug fix.
                        </li>
                        <li>Once a branch is ready for it (it’s been tested, peer-reviewed, etc.), it can be merged back
                            to the main branch. The main branch may be called differently: in Git it’s called master ,
                            in SVN it’s called trunk.
                        </li>
                        <li>While coding on their branch, developers are meant to work in small, atomic iterations,
                            called commits. All commits have a commit message describing in one sentence what’s in
                            there.
                        </li>
                        <li>All commits together are called the history , and it’s a big deal to write meaningful
                            commits and commit messages in order to keep the project’s history clean at a glance, to
                            understand what has been going on and who did what.
                        </li>
                        <li>Some people might be modifying the same pieces on the codebase on different branches, and
                            this could create conflicts when one merges those branches together. Some of those conflicts
                            can obviously only be fixed by a human, and each system has a different way to manage merge
                            conflicts.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="container" id="git_and_github">
                    <h3 class="_heading3">Git and Github</h3>
                    <p>Git doesn't copy-paste the whole codebase when branching and tagging, but stores each commit as a
                        code iteration, in an organized structure that resembles a tree. This allows it to have a much
                        smarter merging algorithm, and it almost never bothers you with conflicts, except for those that
                        really need a human decision. As a result, the cost of branching/merging is very low, and people
                        typically branch/merge a lot, therefore one should never directly work on the “master” branch,
                        if they’re not the only developer on the project. Also: unlike its predecessors, Git allows to
                        work and commit without needing to talk with a server, which allows to work on planes, for
                        instance; and it also can work as a decentralized (peer-to-peer) system, although it’s very
                        rarely done that way.</p>
                    <p>A particularity about Git, is that it’s designed to be usable without a central repository (you
                        can pull code from your friend’s computer, and push you work back there, for instance), but not
                        many people use it that way. There is usually a central Git server that the whole team pushes
                        code to and pulls code from; however, that explains why it is often referred as a
                        “decentralized” system.</p>
                    <p>So that you can work without a server, the commit operation is local, no one other than your
                        computer knows you committed something. You can make several commits however you want, but when
                        you want the server to know about it, you must push them there.</p>
                    <p>You want to be pulling from the repository often if other people may be working on the same
                        branch as you, because each pull performs a merge operation between the code you didn't have,
                        and the code you recently committed locally. Therefore, in order to let you push , Git will
                        sometimes demand that you pull first, so that the merge can be done on your computer, and you
                        take care of potential conflicts.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes, you may have modified 3 files, but there are only two that you wish to include in the
                        commit you’re about the make. Therefore, Git has a notion of “ index”, in which you add your
                        modified files so that they’re included in the next commit you register.</p>
                    <p>How to configure the remote servers your local repository is talking to? They’re called remotes ,
                        and you can configure however many you need. The main one is typically named origin (that’s the
                        name that is setup by default when you clone a project from a remote location in the first
                        place). You can also configure however many branches you need, and name them as you please, and
                        the default one is usually called master.</p>

                    <p>Git Commands:</p>
                    <p>$ git clone url_of_your_remote_repository # Clone a repository from a remote repository
                        $ git add file1 file2 # will add those two files to the index if they were modified
                        $ git commit -m "Meaningful commit message" # will commit those two files (locally)
                        $ git add . # will add all of the modified files to the index at once
                        $ git commit -m "Other meaningful commit message" # will commit all of those files together
                        $ git push origin master # send all commit to the remote server</p>
                    <p>on a branch:</p>
                    <p>$ git branch my_feature # Creating the branch
                        $ git checkout my_feature # Changing the codebase so that we're on that branch now
                        $ git checkout -b my_feature # This does the two previous operations in one ;)
                        $ git add file1 file2
                        $ git commit -m "Meaningful commit message" # We didn't just commit this on the master branch
                        like last time, but on the my_feature one
                        $ git add .
                        $ git commit -m "Other meaningful commit message"
                        $ git push origin my_feature # Notice: we're not pushing master anymore, you just create a new
                        remote branch</p>
                    <p>Next time you want to work on that branch, you should probably do this first:</p>
                    <p>$ git checkout my_feature # Just making sure you're currently on the right branch!
                        $ git pull origin my_feature # Pulling what your coworkers have done so far. </p>
                    <p>And when you’re done with the whole feature and want to merge it to master:</p>
                    <p>$ git checkout master
                        $ git merge my_feature </p>
                    <p>Git provides many more abilities, such as rewriting pieces of the history of the project if you
                        feel the commits were not meaningful enough, displaying the history in visually meaningful ways,
                        …</p>
                    <p>For instance, you should run this right now, and see how a complex history can be viewed really
                        nicely:</p>
                    <p>$ git clone [https://github.com/loverajoel/jstips.git](https://github.com/loverajoel/jstips.git)
                        # You will need a GitHub account for this to work
                        $ cd jstips # changing your directory into the one you just downloaded
                        $ git log --graph --pretty=tformat:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%an
                        %cr)%Creset' --abbrev-commit --date=relative </p>

                    <h4 class="_heading4">Difference between Git and Github</h4>
                    <p>Git is a source code management tool, that comes with a command-line tool for its users. Github
                        is one of many services that provide at the same time:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>a Git repository server to push your code to</li>
                        <li>a web UI to that view your repositories, with their files and commits</li>
                        <li>a number of extra features (managing your team and accesses, …) Two GitHub features you have
                            to get familiarized with are:
                        </li>
                        <li>Forks : you can fork any repository on GitHub, and it will duplicate the repository’s
                            codebase into repository that you own. For instance, if you fork twbs/bootstrap, and your
                            GitHub username is “my_username”, then it will create the my_username/bootstrap repository,
                            and it will remember where it was forked from. Usually, you aren’t allowed to push on other
                            people’s repositories, so that will give you a repository that you can push to, since you
                            own it.
                        </li>
                        <li>Pull requests: once you’ve pushed your code to your repository (or sometimes to a branch of
                            the main repository, if you’re allowed), then you can create a pull request towards the main
                            repository’s master branch. Somebody in charge of the main repository will review your pull
                            request (potentially asking you to change a couple of things), and merge it if it’s suitable
                            to be in the main product.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="_heading3">The Framework</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Read</li>
                        <p>Read everything pertinent to the question / project at hand.(man pages, documentation, books
                            and articles).</p>
                        <li>Think</li>
                        <p>Pause, take a breath and think of the solution.</p>
                        <p>understand all required concepts and algorithms before proceeding to solve the tasks.</p>
                        <p>Once you've found your algorithm or solution - and only then - start to code.</p>
                        <p class="note">Don't write any piece of code before you have the solution. Coding should only
                            be translating you solution to computer code.</p>
                        <p>To think of your solution, try to break things down; a big problem is easier to solve when
                            you break it into smaller, easier problems.</p>
                        <p>Example:</p>
                        <p>First, rephrase the problem. “What am I trying to accomplish here?”</p>
                        <p>Then, go through different examples: “if I understand correctly, then with this
                            input/context/parameters I should output/print/return/draw/… this”… “What could be the edge
                            cases I have to think about to make sure my function/program will always work correctly and
                            never crash?”</p>
                        <p>Next, focus on the basic/regular use cases. “What should my algorithm be?”</p>
                        <p>When you found it, try to “run” it through different examples on a whiteboard or pen/paper
                            and see if the input/output match your expectations.</p>
                        <p>Finally, once you get that, try to see what changes you have to make to take care of all
                            possible edge cases.</p>
                        <p class="note">Sometimes, you will be able to “guess” solutions or complete tasks without
                            totally understanding all the concepts, especially if a task is very small. Do NOT do this,
                            because if you do not develop your critical thinking skills with smaller learning
                            opportunities you will not have the ability to solve harder questions. You need to start
                            thinking like an engineer, and this is how to begin.</p>
                        <p>Use a whiteboard or pen/paper until you are 100% sure your code will work; this maintains
                            focus, and keeps your mind active.</p>
                        <li>Think more + Whiteboard</li>
                        <p>Write or draw out your problem on a whiteboard or paper. It’s easier to visualize your
                            problem when it isn’t pure code.</p>
                        <p>Can’t find the solution? Patiently think more, it’s out there. Also, ensure you read the
                            resources thoroughly.</p>
                        <li>Ask why ?</li>

                    <h3 class="_heading3">VM and Vagrant</h3>
                    <p>we use vagrant because at the end of the day you can end up having completely different behaviors
                        or even have something not work because of software conflicts.</p>
                    <p>Virtual machines - are Virtual “Computers” that will emulate everything from the CPU to the RAM
                        and Disk and provide the functionality of a physical computer.</p>
                    <p>The two types of VMs include:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>System Virtual Machine - (a.k.a full virtualization) provides a substitute for a real
                            machine. They provide functionality needed to execute entire operating systems. A hypervisor
                            uses native execution to share and manage hardware, allowing for multiple environments which
                            are isolated from one another, yet exist on the same physical machine.
                        </li>
                        <li>Process Virtual Machine - are designed to execute computer programs in a
                            platform-independent environment.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Virtual Machines in the context of development are a means to isolate and maintain a stable
                        environment that will basically run the same way on any host (any computer). </p>
                    <p>Using virtual environments prevents developers from saying “I don’t understand, it works on my
                        machine …”.</p>

                    <p>Vagrant is a tool that sits on top of a VM provider.</p>
                    <p>Both vagrant and Virtual Box enable one to use a virtual environment (virtualization) and also
                        allow you to manage and ship isolated development environments.</p>

                    <h3 class="_heading3">Zero Day</h3>
                    <p>A zero-day (also known as 0-day) is a computer-software vulnerability either unknown to those who
                        should be interested in its mitigation (including the vendor of the target software) or known
                        and a patch has not been developed.</p>
                    <p>Until the vulnerability is mitigated, hackers can exploit it to adversely affect programs, data,
                        additional computers or a network. An exploit directed at a zero-day is called a zero-day
                        exploit, or zero-day attack.</p>
                    <p>The term "zero-day" originally referred to the number of days since a new piece of software was
                        released to the public, so "zero-day software" was obtained by hacking into a developer's
                        computer before release.</p>
                    <p>Eventually the term was applied to the vulnerabilities that allowed this hacking, and to the
                        number of days that the vendor has had to fix them. Once the vendor learns of the vulnerability,
                        they will usually create patches or advise workarounds to mitigate it.</p>
                    <p>The more recently that the vendor has become aware of the vulnerability, the more likely it is
                        that no fix or mitigation has been developed. Once a fix is developed, the chance of the exploit
                        succeeding decreases as more users apply the fix over time.</p>

                    <h3 class="_heading3">What is the shell</h3>
                    <p>the shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating
                        system to perform.</p>
                    <p>in old days, it was the only user interface on Unix systems such as Linux.</p>
                    <p>Nowadays we have GUIs and CLIs such as the shell.</p>
                    <p>on most linux systems, a program called bash (Bourne Again Shell) - an enhanced version of the
                        original Unix shell program, sh, written by Steve Bourne - acts as the shell program.</p>

                    <h4 class="_heading4">What is a terminal?</h4>
                    <p>it's a program called a terminal emulator.</p>
                    <p>it's a program that opens a window (which has shell prompts - contain username and name of the
                        machine followed by a dollar sign) and lets you interact with the shell.</p>
                    <p>it simply gives us access to a shell session.</p>
                    <p>examples of terminal emulators on linux:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Gnome-terminal</li>
                        <li>konsole</li>
                        <li>xterm</li>
                        <li>rxvt</li>
                        <li>kvt</li>
                        <li>nxterm</li>
                        <li>eterm</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="notes">if the last character of your shell prompt is # rather than $, you're operating as
                        the superuser. This means you have admin privileges. This can be dangerous, since you are able
                        to delete or overwrite any file on the system. Unless you absolutely need admin privileges,
                        don't operate as the superuser.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="container" id="navigation">
                    <h3 class="_heading3">Navigation</h3>
                    <p>This will focus on three commands: pwd, cd and ls</p>

                    <h4 class="_heading4">File system organization</h4>
                    <p>Like Windows, the files on a Linux system are arranged in what is called a hierarchical directory
                        structure. </p>
                    <p>This means that they are organized in a tree-like pattern of directories (called folders in other
                        systems), which may contain files and subdirectories. </p>
                    <p>The first directory in the file system is called the root directory. The root directory contains
                        files and subdirectories, which contain more files and subdirectories and so on and so on.</p>
                    <p>One important difference between Windows and Unix-like operating systems such as Linux is that
                        Linux does not employ the concept of drive letters.</p>
                    <p>While Windows drive letters split the file system into a series of different trees (one for each
                        device), Linux always has a single tree.</p>
                    <p>Different storage devices may be different branches of the tree, but there is always just a
                        single tree.</p>

                    <h4 class="_heading4">pwd</h4>
                    <p>Since the command line interface cannot provide graphic pictures of the file system structure, we
                        must have a different way of representing it. To do this, think of the file system tree as a
                        maze, and that we are standing in it. At any given moment, we are located in a single directory.
                        Inside that directory, we can see its files and the pathway to its parent directory and the
                        pathways to the subdirectories of the directory in which we are standing.</p>
                    <p>The directory we are standing in is called the working directory. To see the name of the working
                        directory, we use the pwd command.</p>
                    <div class="container linux_command">
                        <p>pwd</p>
                    </div>

                    <h4 class="_heading4">ls</h4>
                    <p>When we first log on to our Linux system, the working directory is set to our home directory.
                        This is where we put our files. On most systems, the home directory will be called
                        /home/user_name, but it can be anything according to the whims of the system administrator.</p>
                    <p>To list the files in the working directory, we use the ls command.</p>
                    <div class="container linux_command">
                        <p>ls</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Ways we can use ls:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>ls : list the files in the working dir</li>
                        <li>ls /dir_path : list files in the dir specified</li>
                        <li>ls -l : list files in the working dir in long format</li>
                        <li>ls -l /dir_path : list files in the dir_path in long format</li>
                        <li>ls -la .. : list all files (even one with names beginning with a period character, which are
                            normally hidden) in the parent of the working dir in long format.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="_heading4">cd</h4>
                    <p>To change the working directory (where we are standing in the maze) we use the cd command. To do
                        this, we type cd followed by the pathname of the desired working directory. </p>
                    <p>A pathname is the route we take along the branches of the tree to get to the directory we want.
                        Pathnames can be specified two different ways; absolute pathnames or relative pathnames.</p>
                    <h5 class="_heading5">absolute pathname</h5>
                    <p>An absolute pathname begins with the root directory and follows the tree branch by branch until
                        the path to the desired directory or file is completed. For example, there is a directory on
                        your system in which most programs are installed. The pathname of the directory is /usr/bin.
                        This means from the root directory (represented by the leading slash in the pathname) there is a
                        directory called "usr" which contains a directory called "bin".</p>
                    <p>example</p>
                    <div class="container linux_command">
                        <p>cd /usr/bin</p>
                    </div>
                    <h5 class="_heading5">relative pathname</h5>
                    <p>starts from the working directory. To do this, it uses a couple of special notations to represent
                        relative positions in the file system tree. These special notations are "." (dot) and ".." (dot
                        dot).</p>
                    <p>The "." notation refers to the working directory itself and the ".." notation refers to the
                        working directory's parent directory.</p>

                    <p class="notes">If we type cd followed by nothing, cd will change the working directory to our home
                        directory.</p>
                    <p class="notes">A related shortcut is to type cd ~user_name. In this case, cd will change the
                        working directory to the home directory of the specified user.</p>
                    <p class="notes">Typing cd - changes the working directory to the previous one.</p>

                    <h4 class="_heading4">Facts about file names</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>File names that begin with a period character are hidden. This only means that ls will not
                            list them unless we say ls -a. When your account was created, several hidden files were
                            placed in your home directory to configure things for your account. Later on we will take a
                            closer look at some of these files to see how you can customize our environment. In
                            addition, some applications will place their configuration and settings files in your home
                            directory as hidden files.
                        </li>
                        <li>File names in Linux, like Unix, are case sensitive. The file names "File1" and "file1" refer
                            to different files.
                        </li>
                        <li>Linux has no concept of a "file extension" like Windows systems. You may name files any way
                            you like. However, while Linux itself does not care about file extensions, many application
                            programs do.
                        </li>
                        <li>Though Linux supports long file names which may contain embedded spaces and punctuation
                            characters, limit the punctuation characters to period, dash, and underscore. Most
                            importantly, do not embed spaces in file names. If you want to represent spaces between
                            words in a file name, use underscore characters. You will thank yourself later.

                    <h4 class="_heading4">less</h4>
                    <p>less is a program that lets us view text files. This is very handy since many of the files used
                        to control and configure Linux are human readable.</p>
                    <p>What is "text"?</p>
                    <p>There are many ways to represent information on a computer. All methods involve defining a
                        relationship between the information and some numbers that will be used to represent it.
                        Computers, after all, only understand numbers and all data is converted to numeric
                        representation.</p>
                    <p>Some of these representation systems are very complex (such as compressed multimedia files),
                        while others are rather simple. One of the earliest and simplest is called ASCII text. ASCII
                        (pronounced "As-Key") is short for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. This is a
                        simple encoding scheme that was first used on Teletype machines to map keyboard characters to
                        numbers.</p>
                    <p>Text is a simple one-to-one mapping of characters to numbers. It is very compact. Fifty
                        characters of text translates to fifty bytes of data. Throughout a Linux system, many files are
                        stored in text format and there are many Linux tools that work with text files. Even Windows
                        systems recognize the importance of this format. The well-known NOTEPAD.EXE program is an editor
                        for plain ASCII text files.</p>

                    <p>As we wander around our Linux system, it is helpful to determine what kind of data a file
                        contains before we try to view it.</p>
                    <p>This is where the file command comes in. file will examine a file and tell us what kind of file
                        it is.</p>
                    <p>The file command:</p>

                        <p>file name_of_file</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>The file program can recognize most types of files, such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>ASCII text - name says it all (viewable as text? yes)</li>
                        <li>Bourne-Again shell script text - A bash script (viewable as text? yes)</li>
                        <li>ELF 64-bit LSB executable - An executable binary program ((viewable as text? no))</li>
                        <li>ELF 64-bit LSB shared object - A shared library (viewable as text? no)</li>
                        <li>GNU tar archive - A tape archive file. A common way of storing groups of files. (viewable as
                            text? no, use tar tvf to view listing)
                        </li>
                        <li>gzip compressed data - An archive compressed with gzip (viewable as text? no)</li>
                        <li>HTML document text - A web page (viewable as text? yes)</li>
                        <li>JPEG image data - A compressed JPEG image (viewable as text? no)</li>
                        <li>PostScript document text - A PostScript file. (viewable as text? yes)</li>
                        <li>Zip archive data - An archive compressed with zip. (viewable as text? yes)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="notes">While it may seem that most files cannot be viewed as text, a surprising number can
                        be. This is especially true of the important configuration files. During our adventure we will

                        <li>/ :The root directory where the file system begins. The root directory will probably contain
                            only subdirectories.
                        </li>
                        <li>/boot :This is where the Linux kernel and boot loader files are kept. The kernel is a file
                            called vmlinuz.
                        </li>
                        <li>/etc :The /etc directory contains the configuration files for the system. All of the files
                            in /etc should be text files. Some points of interest are:
                            /etc/passwd
                            The passwd file contains the essential information for each user. This is where user
                            accounts are defined.
                            /etc/fstab
                            The fstab file contains a table of devices that get mounted when the system boots. This file
                            defines the system's disk drives.
                            /etc/hosts
                            This file lists the network host names and IP addresses that are intrinsically known to the
                            system.
                            /etc/init.d
                            This directory contains the scripts that start various system services at boot time.
                        </li>
                        <li>/bin, /usr/bin :These two directories contain most of the programs for the system. The /bin
                            directory has the essential programs that the system requires to operate, while /usr/bin
                            contains applications for the system's users.
                        </li>
                        <li>/sbin, /usr/sbin :The sbin directories contain programs for system administration, mostly
                            for use by the superuser.
                        </li>
                        <li>/usr :The /usr directory contains a variety of things that support user applications. Some
                            highlights:
                            /usr/share/X11
                            Support files for the X Window system
                            /usr/share/dict
                            Dictionaries for the spelling checker. Yes, Linux comes with a spelling checker. See look
                            and aspell.
                            /usr/share/doc
                            Various documentation files in a variety of formats.
                            /usr/share/man
                            The man pages are kept here.
                        </li>
                        <li>/usr/local :/usr/local and its subdirectories are used for the installation of software and
                            other files for use on the local machine. What this really means is that software that is
                            not part of the official distribution (which usually goes in /usr/bin) goes here.

                            When you find interesting programs to install on your system, they should be installed in
                            one of the /usr/local directories. Most often, the directory of choice is /usr/local/bin.
                        </li>
                        <li>/var The /var directory contains files that change as the system is running. This includes:
                            /var/log
                            Directory that contains log files. These are updated as the system runs. It's a good idea to
                            view the files in this directory from time to time, to monitor the health of your system.
                            /var/spool
                            This directory is used to hold files that are queued for some process, such as mail messages
                            and print jobs. When a user's mail first arrives on the local system (assuming it has local
                            mail, a rare occurrence on modern machines that are not mail servers), the messages are
                            first stored in /var/spool/mail
                        </li>
                        <li>/lib :The shared libraries (similar to DLLs in that other operating system) are kept here.
                        </li>
                        <li>/home :/home is where users keep their personal work. In general, this is the only place
                            users are allowed to write files. This keeps things nice and clean :-)
                        </li>
                        <li>/root :This is the superuser's home directory.</li>
                        <li>/tmp :/tmp is a directory in which programs can write their temporary files.</li>
                        <li>/dev :The /dev directory is a special directory, since it does not really contain files in
                            the usual sense. Rather, it contains devices that are available to the system. In Linux
                            (like Unix), devices are treated like files. You can read and write devices as though they
                            were files. For example /dev/fd0 is the first floppy disk drive, /dev/sda is the first hard
                            drive. All the devices that the kernel understands are represented here.
                        </li>
                        <li>/proc :The /proc directory is also special. This directory does not contain files. In fact,
                            this directory does not really exist at all. It is entirely virtual. The /proc directory
                            contains little peep holes into the kernel itself. There are a group of numbered entries in
                            this directory that correspond to all the processes running on the system. In addition,
                            there are a number of named entries that permit access to the current configuration of the
                            system. Many of these entries can be viewed. Try viewing /proc/cpuinfo. This entry will tell
                            you what the kernel thinks of the system's CPU.
                        </li>
                        <li>/media :Finally, we come to /media, a normal directory which is used in a special way. The
                            /media directory is used for mount points. As we learned in the second lesson, the different
                            physical storage devices (like hard disk drives) are attached to the file system tree in
                            various places. This process of attaching a device to the tree is called mounting. For a
                            device to be available, it must first be mounted.

                            When your system boots, it reads a list of mounting instructions in the /etc/fstab file,
                            which describes which device is mounted at which mount point in the directory tree. This
                            takes care of the hard drives, but we may also have devices that are considered temporary,
                            such as optical disks and USB storage devices. Since these are removable, they do not stay
                            mounted all the time. The /media directory is used by the automatic device mounting
                            mechanisms found in modern desktop oriented Linux distributions. To see what devices and
                            mount points are used, type mount.
                        </li>

                        <p>lrwxrwxrwx 25 Jul 3 16:42 System.map -> /boot/System.map-4.0.36-3</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Notice the files, System.map, module-info and vmlinuz. See the strange notation after the file
                        names?</p>
                    <p>Files such as this are called symbolic links. Symbolic links are a special type of file that
                        points to another file. With symbolic links, it is possible for a single file to have multiple
                        names. Here's how it works: Whenever the system is given a file name that is a symbolic link, it
                        transparently maps it to the file it is pointing to.</p>
                    <p>Just what is this good for? This is a very handy feature. Let's consider the directory listing
                        above (which is the /boot directory of an old system). This system has had multiple versions of
                        the Linux kernel installed. We can see this from the files vmlinuz-4.0.36-0.7 and
                        vmlinuz-4.0.36-3. These file names suggest that both version 4.0.36-0.7 and 4.0.36-3 are
                        installed. Because the file names contain the version it is easy to see the differences in the
                        directory listing. However, this would be confusing to programs that rely on a fixed name for
                        the kernel file. These programs might expect the kernel to simply be called "vmlinuz". Here is
                        where the beauty of the symbolic link comes in. By creating a symbolic link called vmlinuz that
                        points to vmlinuz-4.0.36-3, we have solved the problem.</p>
                    <p class="notes">To create symbolic links, we use the ln command.</p>

                <div class="container" id="manipulating_files">
                    <h3 class="_heading3">Manipulating files</h3>
                    <p>Commands looked at are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>cp - copy files and dirs</li>
                        <li>mv - move or rename files and directories</li>
                        <li>rm - remove files and directories</li>
                        <li>mkdir - create directories</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Now, to be frank, some of the tasks performed by these commands are more easily done with a
                        graphical file manager. With a file manager, you can drag and drop a file from one directory to
                        another, cut and paste files, delete files, etc. So why use these old command line programs?</p>
                    <p>The answer is power and flexibility. While it is easy to perform simple file manipulations with a
                        graphical file manager, complicated tasks can be easier with the command line programs. For
                        example, how would you copy all the HTML files from one directory to another, but only copy
                        files that did not exist in the destination directory or were newer than the versions in the
                        destination directory? Pretty hard with with a file manager. Pretty easy with the command
                        line:</p>
                    <div class="container linux_command">
                        <p>cp -u *.html destination</p>

                    <h4 class="_heading4">Wildcards</h4>
                    <p>shell feature that makes these commands so powerful. Since the shell uses filenames so much, it
                        provides special characters to help you rapidly specify groups of filenames. These special
                        characters are called wildcards. Wildcards allow you to select filenames based on patterns of
                        characters.</p>

                        <li>[character] Matches any character that is a member of the set characters. The set of
                            characters may also be expressed as a POSIX character class

                    <h4 class="_heading4">What are commands?</h4>
                    <p>commands can be one of 4 different kinds:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>An executable program like all those files we saw in /usr/bin. Within this category,
                            programs can be compiled binaries such as programs written in C and C++, or programs written
                            in scripting languages such as the shell, Perl, Python, Ruby, etc.
                        </li>
                        <li>A command built into the shell itself. bash provides a number of commands internally called
                            shell builtins. The cd command, for example, is a shell builtin.
                        </li>
                        <li>A shell function. These are miniature shell scripts incorporated into the environment. We
                            will cover configuring the environment and writing shell functions in later lessons, but for
                            now, just be aware that they exist.
                        </li>
                        <li>An alias. Commands that we can define ourselves, built from other commands. This will be
                            covered in a later lesson.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4 class="_heading4">README and Other documentation files</h4>
                    <p>Many software packages installed on your system have documentation files residing in the
                        /usr/share/doc directory. Most of these are stored in plain text format and can be viewed with
                        less. Some of the files are in HTML format and can be viewed with a web browser. We may
                        encounter some files ending with a “.gz” extension. This indicates that they have been
                        compressed with the gzip compression program. The gzip package includes a special version of
                        less called zless that will display the contents of gzip-compressed text files.</p>

                <div class="container" id="shebang">
                    <h3 class="_heading3">Shebang</h3>
                    <p>In computing, a shebang is the character sequence consisting of the characters number sign and
                        exclamation mark (#!) at the beginning of a script.</p>
                    <p>It is also called sha-bang (supposed to be misheard or confused by the author in his relatively
                        recent book, post 2010), hashbang, pound-bang, or hash-pling.</p>
                    <p>When a text file with a shebang is used as if it is an executable in a Unix-like operating
                        system, the program loader mechanism parses the rest of the file's initial line as an
                        interpreter directive. The loader executes the specified interpreter program, passing to it as
                        an argument the path that was initially used when attempting to run the script, so that the
                        program may use the file as input data.[8] For example, if a script is named with the path
                        path/to/script, and it starts with the following line, #!/bin/sh, then the program loader is
                        instructed to run the program /bin/sh, passing path/to/script as the first argument. In Linux,
                        this behavior is the result of both kernel and user-space code.</p>
                    <p>The shebang line is usually ignored by the interpreter, because the "#" character is a comment
                        marker in many scripting languages; some language interpreters that do not use the hash mark to
                        begin comments still may ignore the shebang line in recognition of its purpose.</p>

                    <h4 class="_heading4">Shebang lines</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>#!/bin/sh – Execute the file using the Bourne shell, or a compatible shell, assumed to be in
                            the /bin directory
                        </li>
                        <li>#!/bin/bash – Execute the file using the Bash shell</li>
                        <li>#!/usr/bin/pwsh – Execute the file using PowerShell</li>
                        <li>#!/usr/bin/env python3 – Execute with a Python interpreter, using the env program search
                            path to find it
                        </li>
                        <li>#!/bin/false – Do nothing, but return a non-zero exit status, indicating failure. Used to
                            prevent stand-alone execution of a script file intended for execution in a specific context,
                            such as by the . command from sh/bash, source from csh/tcsh, or as a .profile, .cshrc, or
                            .login file.
                        </li>

                <div class="container" id="more_tips">
                    <h3 class="_heading3">More tips</h3>
                    <p>if you cat the file, the next prompt will be appended to the final "line" if it does not end with
                        a newline</p>
                    <p>It's not about adding an extra newline at the end of a file, it's about not removing the newline
                        that should be there.</p>
                    <p>text file under unix, consists of a series of lines, each of which end with \n. A file that is
                        not empty and does not end with a newline is therefore not a text file.</p>
                    <p>Utilities that are supposed to operate on text files may not cope well with files that don't end
                        with a newline; historical Unix utilities might ignore the text after the last newline</p>
                    <p>With GNU diff, if one of the files being compared ends with a newline but not the other, it is
                        careful to note that fact. So diff uses this special text \ No newline at end of file to
                        differentiate a file that didn't end in a newline from a file that did.</p>

                    <h3 class="_heading3">Permissions</h3>
                    <p>The Unix-like operating systems, such as Linux differ from other computing systems in that they
                        are not only multitasking but also multi-user.</p>
                    <p>It means that more than one user can be operating the computer at the same time. While a desktop
                        or laptop computer only has one keyboard and monitor, it can still be used by more than one
                        user. For example, if the computer is attached to a network, or the Internet, remote users can
                        log in via ssh (secure shell) and operate the computer. In fact, remote users can execute
                        graphical applications and have the output displayed on a remote computer. The X Window system
                        supports this.</p>
                    <p>The multi-user capability of Unix-like systems is a feature that is deeply ingrained into the
                        design of the operating system. If we remember the environment in which Unix was created, this
                        makes perfect sense. Years ago before computers were "personal," they were large, expensive, and
                        centralized. A typical university computer system consisted of a large mainframe computer
                        located in some building on campus and terminals were located throughout the campus, each
                        connected to the large central computer. The computer would support many users at the same
                        time.</p>
                    <p>In order to make this practical, a method had to be devised to protect the users from each other.
                        After all, we wouldn't want the actions of one user to crash the computer, nor would we allow
                        one user to interfere with the files belonging to another user.</p>
                    <p>command covered are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>chmod - modify file access rights</li>
                        <li>su - temporarily become the superuser</li>
                        <li>sudo - temporarily become the superuser</li>
                        <li>chown - change file ownership</li>
                        <li>chrgrp - change file's group ownership</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="_heading4">File permissions</h4>
                    <p>On a Linux system, each file and directory is assigned access rights for the owner of the file,
                        the members of a group of related users, and everybody else.</p>
                    <p>Rights can be assigned to read a file, to write a file, and to execute a file (i.e., run the file
                        as a program).</p>
                    <p>when we use ls command we can view file permissions which can be intepreted as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>- :file type (- indicate a regular file, d indicates a directory)</li>
                        <li>rwx - first three represent Read, Write and Execute permissions for the file owner.</li>
                        <li>rwx - second three represent represent Read, Write and Execute permissions for the group
                            owner of the file
                        </li>
                        <li>rwx - last three represent represent Read, Write and Execute permissions for all other
                            users
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="_heading4">chmod</h4>
                    <p>the command is used to change permissions of a file or dir.</p>
                    <p>There are two ways to specify the permissions.</p>

                    <h5 class="_heading5">using Octal notation to specify file permissions</h5>
                    <p>it's easy to think of permission settings as a series of bits (that's how the computer thinks
                        about them)</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>rwx rwx rwx = 111 111 111</li>
                        <li>rw- rw- rw- = 110 110 110</li>
                        <li>rwx --- --- = 111 000 000</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>therefore</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>rwx = 111 in binary = 7</li>
                        <li>rw- = 110 in binary = 6</li>
                        <li>r-x = 101 in binary = 5</li>
                        <li>r-- = 100 in binary = 4</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>if we represent each of the three sets of permissions (owner, group, others) as a single digit,
                        we have a convenient way of expressing the possible permissions settings.</p>
                    <p>example, to set permissions to read and write for the owner, but private for other:</p>
                    <div class="container linux_command">
                        <p>chmod 600 file_name</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>list of common settings. Those beginning with 7 are used with programs (since they enable
                        execution).</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>777 (rwxrwxrwx) - now restrictions on permissions. Anybody my do anything. Generally not a
                            desirable setting.
                        </li>
                        <li>775 (rwxr-xr-x) - owner may read, write and execute, all others may read and execute the
                            file. common for programs used by all users
                        </li>
                        <li>700 (rwx------) - owner may read, write and execute, nobody else has any rights. useful for
                            programs only the owner may use and must be kept private from others
                        </li>
                        <li>666 (rw-rw-rw-) - all users may read and write the file</li>
                        <li>644 (rw-r--r--) - owner may read and write a file, while all others may only read the file.
                            common setting for data files that everybody may read, but only the owner may change.
                        </li>
                        <li>600 (rw-------) - owner may read and write a file, all others have no rights. common setting
                            for data files that the owner want to keep private.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4 class="_heading4">Directory permissions</h4>
                    <p>chmod command can also be used to control access permissions for dirs.</p>
                    <p>octal notation can be used but the meaning of r, w, x attributes is different:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>r - allows contents of the dir to be listed if the x attribute is also set</li>
                        <li>w - allows files within the dir to be created, deleted or renamed if the x attribute is also
                            set.
                        </li>
                        <li>x - allows a directory to be entered.(ie. cd dir)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>some useful settings for dirs:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>777 (rwxrwxrwx) - no restrictions on permissions. anybody may list files, create new files
                            in the dir and delete files in the dir. Generally not a good setting.
                        </li>
                        <li>755 (rwxr-xr-x) - directory owner has full access. others may list the dir, but cannot
                            create files nor delete them. common for dirs that you wish to share with other users.
                        </li>
                        <li>700 (rwx------) - directory owner has full access. other have no rights. useful for dirs
                            only the owner may use and must be kept private from others.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4 class="_heading4">Becoming a superuser for a short while</h4>
                    <p>It is often necessary to become the superuser to perform important system administration tasks,
                        but as we know, we should not stay logged in as the superuser.</p>
                    <p>In most distributions, there is a program that can give you temporary access to the superuser's
                        privileges. This program is called su (short for substitute user) and can be used in those cases
                        when you need to be the superuser for a small number of tasks.</p>
                    <p>se cases when you need to be the superuser for a small number of tasks. To become the superuser,
                        simply type the su command. You will be prompted for the superuser's password:</p>
                    <div class="container linux_command">
                        <p>su</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>After executing the su command, we have a new shell session as the superuser. To exit the
                        superuser session, type exit and we will return to your previous session.</p>

                    <p>In most modern distributions, an alternate method is used. Rather than using su, these systems
                        employ the sudo command instead. With sudo, one or more users are granted superuser privileges
                        on an as needed basis.</p>
                    <p>To execute a command as the superuser, the desired command is simply preceded with the sudo
                        command. After the command is entered, the user is prompted for the their own password rather
                        than the superuser's:</p>
                    <p>example</p>
                    <div class="container linux_command">
                        <p>sudo some_command</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>modern distributions don't even set the root account password thus making it impossible to log in
                        as the root user. A root shell is still possible with sudo by using the "-i" option:</p>
                    <div class="container linux_command">
                        <p>sudo -i</p>
                    </div>

                    <h4 class="_heading4">Changing File Ownership</h4>
                    <p>We can change the owner of a file by using the chown command.</p>
                    <p>Here's an example: Suppose we wanted to change the owner of some_file from "me" to "you". We
                        could:</p>
                    <div class="container linux_command">
                        <p>sudo chown you some_file</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>in order to change the owner of a file, we must have superuser privileges. To do this, our
                        example employed the sudo command to execute chown.</p>
                    <p>chown works the same way on directories as it does on files.</p>

                    <h4 class="_heading4">Changing Group Ownership</h4>
                    <p>The group ownership of a file or directory may be changed with chgrp.</p>
                    <p>example:</p>
                    <div class="container linux_command">
                        <p>chgrp new_group some_file</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>changes the group ownership of some_file from its previous group to "new_group".</p>
                    <p>We must be the owner of the file or directory to perform a chgrp.</p>

                    <h4 class="_heading4">What is C?</h4>
                    <p>C is an imperative (procedural) language</p>
                    <p>All the code has to be inside a function</p>
                    <p>C files are source code of your program</p>
                    <p>You have to compile C files with a compiler (for instance gcc) to create an executable file.</p>
                    <p>At the coarsest level, an obvious feature is the multi-file structure of a program.</p>
                    <p>the language permits separate compilation, where parts of a complete program can be kept in one
                        or more source files and compiled independently of each other.</p>
                    <p>the idea is that compilation process will produce files which can then be linked together using
                        whatever link editor or loader.</p>
                    <p>white spaces in c can occur practically anywhere in a program except in the middle of
                        identifiers, strings or character constants.</p>


                    <h4 class="_heading4">Comments</h4>
                    <p>Begins with /* and ends with */</p>
                    <p>comments are introduced to a c program by the /* characters, from then on, everything found up to
                        and including the pair of characters */ is gobbled up and the whole lot is replaced by a single
                        space.</p>
                    <p>unlike old versions, a comment is now treated a single space.</p>
                    <p>can be inserted anywhere and a white-space character is allowed</p>
                    <p>comments don't nest (/* does not /* work */ */</p>
                    <p>Use comments to document your code</p>

                    <p>Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie was an American computer scientist.</p>
                    <p>He is best known as the creator of the C programming language and with long-time colleague Ken
                        Thompson, a key developer of the Unix operating system and B programming language.</p>
                    <p>Ritchie and Thompson used C to write UNIX.</p>
                    <p>graduated from Harvard University with degrees in physics and applied mathematics.</p>
                    <p>Thompson found an old PDP-7 machine and developed his own application programs and operating
                        system from scratch aided by Ritchie and others.</p>

                    <h3 class="_heading3">Why C programming is Awesome</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Almost all popular languages are built on top of the C language (python, ruby, java,
                            javascript) - code you find in python is the same code you'll find in c if you break it down
                            well enough.
                        </li>
                        <li>500, 000 lines of c code powered the mars curiosity rover - c is the great choice for
                            embedded systems mostly found on the rover.
                        </li>
                        <li>It's the coding language of choice for kernel development - a kernel is the central part of
                            an OS. It manages the tasks of the computer and the hardware - most importantly memory and
                            CPU time.
                        </li>
                        <li>It's been around for more than 30 years.</li>
                        <li>writing code in c will ultimately tell you how a computer really works. Makes you appreciate
                            higher level languages like python.
                        </li>
                        <li>It's in high demand for jobs.</li>
                        <li>It's portable and efficient.</li>

                        compilation process</a></p>
                    <p>let's start with components of a compiler:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Preprocessor</li>
                        <li>Compiler</li>
                        <li>Assembler</li>
                        <li>Linker</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>when c code is run it's passed to the preprocessor that generates an intermediate file given to
                        the compiler to convert the file into assembly code that the comp can understand.</p>
                    <p>Assembler converts assembly code into binary (or object) code.</p>
                    <p>Linker links the object code with libraries used, then write everything in a single file that it
                        executable - like the exe file.(Two types of linking: static and dynamic linking)</p>

                    <h3 class="_heading3">Setting up Emacs</h3>
                    <p>Emacs by default used spaces instead of tabs to indent. To change this, in the .emacs file in
                        your home dir, type:</p>
                    <div class="container emacs_code">
                        <pre>
                            (setq c-default-style "bsd"

                        </pre>
                    </div>
                    <p>to highlight lines exceeding 80 characters and trailing whitespace, you can add this to your

                    <h3 class="_heading3">Hash-bang under the hood</h3>
                    <p>The hash-bang directive #! is actually processed by the kernel:</p>
                    <p>when a file starts with 0x23, 0x21 (which is #!) the kernel will interpret what follows as the
                        path to executable and attempt to run.</p>
                    <p>From Dennis Ritchie introduced in '#!' in research Unix, Jan 1980.</p>
                    <p>from dmr Thur Jan 10 04:25:49 1980 remote from research</p>
                    <p>The system has been changed so that if a file being executed begins with the magic character #!,
                        the rest of the line is understood to be the name of an interpreter for the executed file.</p>
                    <p>Previously (and in fact still) the shell did much of this job; it automatically executed itself
                        on a text file with executable mode when the text file's name was typed as a command.</p>
                    <p>Putting the facility into the system gives the following benefits.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It makes shell scripts more like real executable files, because they can be the subject of
                            'exec.'
                        </li>
                        <li>If you do a 'ps' while such a command is running, its real name appears instead of
                            'sh'.Likewise, accounting is done on the basis of the real name.
                        </li>
                        <li>Shell scripts can be set-user-ID.</li>
                        <li>It is simpler to have alternate shells available; e.g. if you like the Berkeley csh there is
                            no question about which shell is to interpret a file.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>To take advantage of this wonderful opportunity, put</p>
                    <p>#! /bin/sh</p>
                    <p>at the left margin of the first line of your shell scripts.</p>
                    <p>Blanks after ! are OK, use a complete pathname (no search is done).</p>
                    <p>At the moment the whole line is restricted to 16 characters but this limit will be raised.</p>

                    <h3 class="_heading3">Origin of C</h3>
                    <p>originally developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at Bell labs.</p>
                    <p>the original "K&R" C book was the informal language spec (co-authored with B. Kernighan)</p>
                    <p>has had enormous influence on other modern programming languages.</p>
                    <h3 class="_heading3">C standardization</h3>
                    <p>First there was K&R C - compiler inspired by first publication or description of C language</p>
                    <p>later standardized to ANSI C - (aka C89 or C90) - this is the most portable version of C. Most
                        compilers let you turn on ANSI C mode by using -ansi or -std=c89.</p>
                    <p>C99 - most recent version of C language that extends C89/C90 with new data types, variable length
                        arrays.</p>
                    <p>by default gcc used ANSI C version.</p>
                    <p>use -pedantic for warning messages when you compile</p>
                    <p>-std=c99 - to get some C99 features.</p>

                    <h4 class="_heading4">Identifiers</h4>
                    <p>an identifier is simply the name of a function or some other object.</p>
                    <p>identifier is a fancy term used to mean 'name'.</p>
                    <p>in C, identifiers are used to refer to a number of things; to name variables, functions, labels,
                        tags of structures, unions and enums.</p>
                    <p>rules for construction of identifiers are simple: you may use the 52 upper and lowercase
                        alphabetic characters, the 10 digits and finally the underscore _ which is considered to be an
                        alphabetic character for this purpose.</p>
                    <p>only restriction is the usual one; identifiers must start with an alphabetic character.</p>
                    <p>the length limit of identifiers is 31 characters so if you use longer names, make sure you don't
                        rely on the checking stopping at 31.</p>
                    <p>External identifiers are those that have to be visible outside the current source code file.</p>
                    <p>typical examples of these would be library routines or functions which have to be called from
                        several different source files.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="container" id="integers">
                    <h3 class="_heading3">Integers</h3>
                    <p>there's two type (often called 'flavours') of integer variables.</p>
                    <p>other types can be built from these, but the plain undecorated ints are the base.</p>
                    <p>most obvious pair is the 'signed' int, less obvious is it's close relative the unsigned int.</p>
                    <p>int is the natural choice for undemanding requirements when you just need a simple integral
                        variable, say as a counter in a short loop.</p>
                    <p>there isn't any guarantee about the number of bits that an int can hold, except it will always be
                        16 or more.</p>
                    <p>standard header file &lt;limits.h&gt; details the actual number of bits available in a given
                        implementation.</p>
                    <p>&lt;limits.h&gt; file doesn't quite specify a number of bits, but gives maximum and minimum
                        values for an int instead.</p>
                    <p>the values it gives are 32767 and -32767 which implies 16 bits or more, whether ones or twos
                        complement arithmetic is used.</p>
                    <p>the range specified in the standard for an unsigned int is 0 to at least 65535, meaning that it
                        cannot be negative.</p>
                    <p>the bitwise operators encourage you to think about the number of bits in a variable too, because
                        they give direct access to the bits, which you manipulate one by one or in groups.</p>
                    <p>almost paradoxically, the overall result is that C programmers have an healthy awareness of
                        portability issues which leads to more portable programs.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>arithmetic operators - These are used to perform mathematical calculations like addition,

                        </li>
                        <li>increment / decrement operators - These operators are used to either increase or decrease
                            the value of the variable by one.
                        </li>
                        <li>special operators - &, *, sizeof( ) and ternary operators.</li>

                    <h4 class="_heading4">arithmetic operators</h4>
                    <p>arithmetic operators supported by C include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>+ : adds two operands</li>
                        <li>- : subtracts second operand from the first</li>

                        <li>-- : decrement operator decreases the integer value by one</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="_heading4">Relational operators</h4>
                    <p>most common relational operators are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>== : equal to (checks if values of two operands are equal or not. if yes, condition becomes
                            true.)
                        </li>

                    <h3 class="_heading3">If Statements</h3>
                    <p>control statements enable programmers to control the flow of a program, letting it make decisions
                        on what to code to execute.</p>
                    <p>if statement allows you to control if a program enters a section of code or not based on whether
                        a given condition is true or false.</p>
                    <p>one of the important functions of the if statement is that it allows the program to select an
                        action based upon the user's input.</p>

                    <h5 class="_heading5">True and False</h5>
                    <p>c assumes any non-zero and non-null values as true.</p>
                    <p>c assumes either zero or null values as a false.</p>
                    <p>when you perform comparison with the relational operators, the operator will return 1 if the
                        comparison is true, or 0 if the comparison is false.</p>
                    <p>for example: 0 == 2 evaluates to 0 while 2 == 2 evaluates to 1.</p>

                    <h5 class="_heading5">Basic if syntax</h5>
                    <p>structure of an if statement:</p>
                    <div class="container c_code">
                        <pre>
                            if (boolean_expression_is_TRUE)
                            {
                                /*body of the if statement*/
                                Execute this line of code
                            }
                        </pre>
                    </div>
                    <p>when using if statements, the code that depends on the if statement is called the 'body' of the
                        if statement.</p>

                    <h4 class="_heading4">Else</h4>
                    <p>sometimes when the condition in an if statement evaluates to false, it would be nice to execute
                        some code instead of the code executed when the statement evaluates to true.</p>
                    <p>the 'else' statement effectively says that whatever code after it (whether a single line or code
                        between brackets) is executed if the if statement is FALSE.</p>
                    <p>it can look like this:</p>
                    <div class="container c_code">
                        <pre>
                            if (boolean_expression_is_TRUE)
                            {
                                /*execute these statements if true*/
                            }
                            else
                            {
                                /*execute these statements if false*/
                            }
                        </pre>
                    </div>

                    <h4 class="_heading4">Else if</h4>
                    <p>another use of else is when there are multiple conditional statements that may all evaluate to
                        true, yet you want only one if statement's body to execute.</p>
                    <p>you can use 'else if' statement following an if statement and its body; that way, if the first
                        statement is true, the 'else if' will be ignored, but if the if statement is false, it will then
                        check the condition for the else if statement.</p>
                    <p>if the if statement was true, the else statement will not be checked.</p>
                    <p>it is possible to use numerous else if statements to ensure that only one block of code is
                        executed.</p>
                    <p>when using if...else if...else statements, keep in mind:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>an if can have zero or one else's and it must come after any else if's.</li>
                        <li>an if can have zero to many else if's and they must come before the else.</li>
                        <li>once an else if succeeds, none of the remaining else if's or else's will be tested.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>all these things are given names at the point where they are defined in the program the way the

                    <p>items with external linkage are those accessible throughout the program (library functions are a

                    <p>the idea of a function is to allow you to encapsulate one idea or operation, give it a name, then

                    <p>in well designed properly structured programs, it should be possible to change the way that a
                        function does it's job(as long the job itself does not change) with no effect on the rest of the
                        program.</p>
                    <p>in a hosted environment, there's a function whose name is special; main.</p>
                    <p>this function is the first one entered when your program starts running.</p>

                    <h4 class="_heading4">Function Declaration</h4>
                    <p>a function declaration tells the compiler which arguments and return values the function has.</p>
                    <p>declaration describes three important things about a function:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>function name</li>
                        <li>function return type</li>
                        <li>type of arguments(if any)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>in C, it's recommended to declare functions in advance so the compiler is able to check that it
                        is used correctly.</p>
                    <p>distinction between declaration and definition is that declaration simply describes the type of
                        the function and any arguments that it might take, definition is where the body of a function is
                        provided.</p>

                    <h4 class="_heading4">Function Definition</h4>
                    <p>a function definition is a declaration with the body of the function given too.</p>
                    <p>in C, functions perform the tasks that some other languages split into two parts.</p>
                    <p>most languages use a function to return a value of some sort, typical examples include
                        trigonometric functions like sin, cos or maybe a square root function; c is the same in this
                        respect.</p>
                    <p>other similar jobs are done by what look very much like functions but which don't return a
                        value.</p>
                    <p>the parenthesis that follow the function name are needed to let the compiler know that at this
                        point we are talking about a function and not something else.</p>
                    <p>the body of a function is a compound statement, which is a sequence of other statements
                        surrounded by curly brackets {}.</p>
                    <p>the job of the brackets is to turn several statements in a row into what is effectively a single
                        statement.</p>

                        program.</p>
                    <p>It will request a block of memory from the heap.</p>
                    <p>If the request is granted, the operating system will reserve the requested amount of memory and
                        malloc will return a pointer to the reserved space.</p>
                    <p>when the amount of memory is not needed anymore, you must return it to the operating system by
                        calling the function free.</p>

                    <h3 class="_heading3">Preprocessor statements</h3>
                    <p>preprocessor statements work on a line-by-line basis, the rest of C does not.</p>
                    <p>#include statements are used to read the contents of a specified file, typically to facilitate
                        the use of library functions.</p>
                    <p>the first statement in most c programs #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; is a preprocessor directive.</p>
                    <p>the preprocessor directive #include causes the line containing it to be replaced completely by
                        the contents of another file.</p>
                    <p>the filename found between &lt; and &gt; brackets is a widely used technique to incorporate the
                        text of standard header files without having to go through the effort typing it all
                        yourself.</p>
                    <p>the preprocessor only knows about lines of text; unlike the rest of the language is sensitive to
                        the end of a line and though it is possible to write multi-line preprocessor directives, they
                        are uncommon and a source of some wonder when they are found.</p>
                    <p>any line whose first visible character is a # is a preprocessor directive.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="container" id="define_statements">
                    <h3 class="_heading3">Define Statements</h3>
                    <p>another of the preprocessor's talents which is widely exploited is the #define statement.</p>
                    <p>#define statements are typically used to give names for constants. By convention, the names are
                        in upper case.</p>
                    <p>syntax:</p>
                    <p class="single_line_code">#define IDENTIFIER replacement</p>
                    <p>the statement says that the name represented by IDENTIFIER will be replaced by the text of
                        replacement whenever IDENTIFIER occurs in the program text.</p>
                    <p>invariably, the identifier is a name in upper-case; this is a stylistic convention that helps the
                        reader understand what's goin on.</p>
                    <p>the replacement part can be any text at all- remember the preprocessor doesn't know C, it just
                        works on text.</p>
                    <p>the most common use of the statement is to declare names for constant numbers:</p>
                    <p>examples:</p>
                    <p class="single_line_code">#define PI 3.141592</p>
                    <p class="single_line_code">#define SECS_PER_MIN 60</p>

                    <p>Its first argument is a string of characters to be printed, with each %indicating where one of
                        the other (second, third) arguments is to be substituted and in what form it is to be
                        printed.</p>
                    <p>Each % construction in the first argument of printf is paired with the corresponding second
                        argument, third argument, etc; they must match up properly by number and type.</p>
                    <p>printf is not part of the C language; there is no input or output defined in C itself.</p>
                    <p>printf is just a useful function from the standard library of functions that are normally

                    <p>python is a general-purpose programming language created by Guido Van Rossum.</p>
                    <p>python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language.</p>
                    <p>Python is an interpreted language. </p>
                    <p>it has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to
                        object-oriented programming.</p>
                    <p>Python's elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an
                        ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most
                        platforms.</p>
                    <p>with python you can do:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>GUI development</li>
                        <li>Web application</li>

                    </ul>
                    <h4 class="_heading4">Origin of the name Python</h4>
                    <p>the language is named after the BBC show "Monty Python's Flying Circus" and has nothing to do
                        with reptiles.</p>

                    <h5 class="_heading5">Python is an interpreted language</h5>
                    <p>when you run python program, an interpreter will parse python program line by line basis, as
                        compared to compiled languages like C or C++, where the compiler first compiles the program and
                        then start running.</p>
                    <p>So what's the difference?</p>
                    <p>The difference is that interpreted languages are a little bit slow as compared to compiled
                        languages.</p>
                    <p>writing codes in compiled languages is a daunting task for a beginner.</p>
                    <p>Also in such languages, you need to write even most basic functions like calculate the length of
                        the array, split the string etc.</p>
                    <p>For more advanced tasks sometimes you need to create your own data structures to encapsulate data
                        in the program. So in C/C++ before you actually start solving your business problem you need to
                        take care of all minor details. This is where Python comes. In Python, you don't need to define
                        any data structure, no need to define small utility functions because Python has everything to
                        get you started.</p>

                    <h5 class="_heading5">Python is dynamically typed</h5>
                    <p>python doesn't require you to define variable data types ahead of time.</p>
                    <p>python automatically infers the data type of the variable based on the type of value it
                        contains.</p>

                    <h5 class="_heading5">Python is strongly typed</h5>
                    <p>PHP or Javascript, convert data of one type to another automatically.</p>
                    <p>For example: In JS, 1 + "2" - converts 1 to a string and concatenates to "2", which results to
                        '12' which is a string.</p>
                    <p>However, in python, such automatic conversions are not allowed.</p>
                    <p>so 1 + "2" would produce an error.</p>

                    <h4 class="_heading4">Types of Python</h4>
                    <p>The official version of python is called Python or CPython. <a href="https://www.python.org/">Download
                        official python</a></p>
                    <p>Another popular distribution of python is Anaconda. It's mainly focused on data science. <a
                            href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Download Anaconda Python</a></p>

                    <h4 class="_heading4">Running Python Programs</h4>
                    <p>Python uses a command-line tool called pip.</p>
                    <p>to run a program stored in a file:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Open the terminal and change current working dir to dir where the file is stored</li>
                        <li>to run the program, type the command:
                            <mark>python3 hello.py</mark>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>alternatively you can make python programs runnable scripts by using these line at the beginning
                        of python scripts, then making the scripts executable using
                        <mark>chmod u+x file_name</mark>
                    </p>
                    <p class="single_line_py">#!/usr/bin/python3</p>

                    <h5 class="_heading5">Getting Help</h5>
                    <p>when you come across a situation when you want to know more about some method or functions,
                        Python has help() function.</p>
                    <p>Syntax:</p>
                    <p>to find information about a class: help(class_name)</p>
                    <p>to find more about method belong to class: help(class_name.method_name)</p>
                    <p>example1: to find more about the int class:</p>
                    <p>on the python shell, type:</p>
                    <p class="py_shell_command">help(int)</p>
                    <p>example2: to find more about arguments required for index() method of str class, type:</p>
                    <p class="py_shell_command">help(str.index)</p>

                    <h3 class="_heading3">Comments</h3>
                    <p>Comments are notes which describe the purpose of the program or how the program works.</p>
                    <p>Comments are not programming statements that Python interpreter executes while running the
                        program.</p>
                    <p>Comments can also be used to write program documentation.</p>
                    <p>In python, any line that begins with a pound sign (#) is considered a comment.</p>
                    <p>Comments at the end of a statement are called end-line comments. (e.g. print("hello, world")
                        #displays hello, world on the console.</p>

                    <h3 class="_heading3">Variables & Data Types</h3>
                    <p>Variables are named locations used to store references to the object stored in memory.</p>
                    <p>names we choose for variables and functions are commonly known as identifiers.</p>
                    <p>in python, rules for identifiers are:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>All identifiers must start with a letter or underscore (_), you can't use digits.</li>
                        <li>Identifiers can contain letter, digits and underscores(_). $, # are not allowed.</li>
                        <li>Identifiers can be of any length.</li>
                        <li>Identifiers can't be a keyword. Keywords are reserved words that python uses for special
                            purposes. Keywords in pythons include:(false, none, true, and, as, pass, break, class,
                            continue, def, del, elif, else, except, finally, for, from, global, if, import, in, is,
                            lambda, nonlocal, not, or, assert, raise, return, try, while, with, yield)
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <h5>Assigning Values to Variables</h5>
                    <p>To assign a value to a variable, equal sign (also known as the assignment operator (=)) is
                        used.</p>
                    <p>Values are basic things that programs work with.</p>
                    <p>in programming, they are also known as literals.</p>
                    <p>literals can be of different types: int (1, 11), float (3.14), string ("hello").</p>
                    <p>in python, everything is object even basic data types like int, float, string.</p>
                    <p>For example:</p>
                    <p class="single_line_py">a = b = c = 100 # this assigns 100 to c, b and a.</p>
                    <div class="container note_better">
                        <p>When a value is assigned to a variable, the variable doesn't store the value itself. Instead,
                            the variable only stores a reference (address) of the object where it is stored in the
                            memory.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, x = 100, stores a reference (or address) to the 100 (an int object).</p>
                        <p>The variable x doesn't store the object 100 itself.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="container" id="new_string_formatting">
                    <h3 class="_heading3">New String Formatting</h3>
                    <h4 class="_heading4">Basic Formatting</h4>
                    <p>simple positional formatting is the most common use-case and should be used if the order of
                        arguments is not likely to change and only have very few elements to concatenate.</p>
                    <p>since elements are represented by something as descriptive as a name, this simple style should
                        only be used to format a relatively small number of elements.</p>
                    <p>Example1:</p>
                    <p class="single_line_py">'{} {}'.format('one', 'two')</p>
                    <p>Example2:</p>
                    <p class="single_line_py">'{} {}'.format(1, 2)</p>

                    <h4 class="_heading4">Value Conversion</h4>
                    <p>the new-style formatter calls by default the _format_() method of an object for its
                        representation.</p>
                    <p>if to render the output of str(...) or repr(...), use !s or !r conversion flags.</p>
                    <p>in %-style you usually use %s for the string representation but there is %r for a repr(...)
                        conversion.</p>
                    <p>Setup</p>
                    <div class="container py">
                        <pre>
                            class Data(object):
                                def __str__(self):
                                    return 'str'

                                def __repr__(self):
                                    return 'repr'
                        </pre>
                    </div>
                    <p class="single_line_py">'{0!s} {0!r}'.format(Data())</p>

                    <h4 class="_heading4">Padding and aligning strings</h4>
                    <p>by default values are formatted to take up only as much characters as needed to represent the
                        content. It is however also possible to define that a value should be padded to a specific
                        length.</p>
                    <p>to align right:</p>
                    <p class="single_line_py">'{:>10}'.format('test')</p>
                    <p>to align left:</p>
                    <p class="single_line_py">'{:10}'.format('test')</p>
                    <p>using a padding character:</p>
                    <p class="single_line_py">'{:_<10}'.format('test')</p>
                    <p>center align values:</p>
                    <p class="single_line_py">'{:^10}'.format('test')</p>
                    <p>When using center alignment where the length of the string leads to an uneven split of the
                        padding characters, the extra character will be placed on the right side:</p>
                    <p class="single_line_py">'{:^6}'.format('zip')</p>

                    <h4 class="_heading4">Truncating long strings</h4>
                    <p>Inverse to padding it is also possible to truncate overly long values to a specific number of
                        characters.</p>
                    <p>The number after a (.) in the format specifies the precision of the output. For strings that
                        means that the output is truncated to the specified length. In our example this would be 5
                        characters.</p>
                    <p class="single_line_py">'{:.5}'.format('xylophone')</p>

                    <h4 class="_heading4">Combining truncating and padding</h4>
                    <p class="single_line_py">'{:10.5}'.format('xylophone')</p>

            <p>Being unemployed doesn’t mean you can’t keep yourself productive.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Consider taking an online course - if you can afford it or receive financial assistance, take an online course to improve your skills in a certain area (especially if it's something accredited and worthy of adding to your resume.)</li>
                <li>Develop a "side hustle" - What are some part-time jobs or freelance projects you can pursue? Could be repairing computer, selling art and craft, babysitting, cleaning, selling snack. Just because you haven't found your new job doesn't mean you can't start working to bring in some extra cash (You might be able to maintain your side hustle even after you find your new job).</li>
                <li>Spend more time with family - family is one of the most important things in life that gives us a sense of meaning and belonging. Often times the busy-ness of our lives can be one of the main forces that take us away from spending time with family. Spend this time having more family dinners and doing this together or visit your parents for a while.</li>
                <li>Go to the gym and exercise more - focus on developing healthy habits, like exercising and dieting. If you can start building these into consistent habits now, then they will be more likely to carry over once you've found a new job. Find small opportunities to do some push-up, sit-ups, jumping-jacks or go for a small walk every morning.</li>
                <li>Build up your social media and online network - having a strong online presence (on Twitter, Instagram or Facebook, LinkedIn) and especially one that is relevant to your skills and career can find you new opportunities, connect your to like minded people who can give advice and tips and even find opportunities for collaboration.</li>

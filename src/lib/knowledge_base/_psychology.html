					<p>Psychologists are just people who weren't smart enough to be psychics.</p>
					<p>If it comes, let it. If it goes, let it.</p>
					<p>Life has many ways of testing a person's will, either by having nothing happen at all or by having everything happen all at once.</p>
					<p>Sometimes, problems don't require a solution to solve them; instead they require maturity to outgrow them.</p>
					<p>We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are.</p>
					<p>Sometimes in life we just need a hug... no words, no advice, just a hug to make you feel better.</p>
					<p>Nothing is permanent. Don't stress yourself too much because no matter how bad the situation is... it will change.</p>
					<p>Criticisms can either make someone better or sap their hope and self-confidence. It has both positives and negatives. Everyone make mistakes after all, and so no one is above critism. The important thing is to understand not just how to deal with it, but how to use it to our benefit so that we can grow and develop ourselves personally or professionally.</p>
					<p>Arguing is fine if you're arguing with the right person. Toxic arguments are always you vs them. Healthy arguments are you and them vs the problem. Don't waste energy arguing with anyone that cares more about protecting their fragile ego, than resolving the problem.</p>
					<p>The antidote of loneliness is selflessness.</p>
					<p>Hunger is the first element of self-discipline. If you can control what you eat and drink, you can control everything else.</p>
					<p>Having good and healthy relationships can make you happier than others.</p>
					<p>Gradually, you fall in love with someone you spend a lot of time with, like a fellow student or a co-worker. This is a phenomenon known as the exposure effect. It's a psychological phenomenon whereby people tend to become attracted to each other the more time they spend together.</p>
					<p>Geeks have intellectualism and functionality (like they provide value with what they know). Nerds only have intellectualism.</p>
					<p>All sorts of things happen everyday, some we can control and some we can't. The only thins we have control of though, is our thougts and our response towards the situation.</p>
					<p>When approaching leaders or great men, study their details first. Like their history, parents, birthday, spouses then as you talk with them use these details to get to them.</p>
					<p>Use a voice note to communicate with important people. No one can ignore a voice note because they will be curios to know what it is you're saying.</p>
					<p>
						In the presence of that which you are not, that which you are is
						not.
					</p>
					<p>
						People scan, they don't read. Our brains are filled with visual
						info. Make your website easy to scan and understand.
					</p>
					<p>
						can't hurt an overthinker, they've already played out all scenarios
						so you're just proving them right.
					</p>
					<p>people are scientifically more honest when they're tired.</p>
					<p>
						Replace fear with curiosity. Curiosity opens the door to an infinite
						stream of possibilities. What you fear the most is what might make
						you infinitely stronger.
					</p>
					<p>
						Avoid using I just wanted to... in you texts. Instead, use simple
						terms like: I'm reaching out to, I'm following up, I'm checking in
						to ...
					</p>
					<p>
						When making a presentation, only have supporting material like
						pictures on your slides. Not what you want to say because people
						can't be reading and concentrating on what you're saying at the same
						time.
					</p>
					<p>Don't give handshakes while sitted.</p>
					<p>
						Using your phone while someone is talking to you makes them feel
						less important.
					</p>
					<p>
						Find comfort in your own skin and waking up to a vacant bed with
						only you. Find peace in the vacancy. This is your second chance to
						become the person you've always dreamt of. Trust the process of
						life. Forgive yourself for giving your heart to those who never
						valued it and restore your faith in love.
					</p>
					<p>
						Whenever speaking in public, get rid of filler words. Instead, pause
						and recollect your thoughts or if answering a question, repeat the
						question as this can give you more time to think about how you're
						going to answer.
					</p>
					<p>
						From the age of 18, you start to parent yourself. So do whtat you
						don't want to do so you can become what you're supposed to be.
					</p>
					<p>
						If someone is trying to make a deal and force you to make a decision
						fast, it's a bad deal. Walk away.
					</p>
					<p>
						When a group of friends is laughing, people look at the person they
						like most.

					<h1 class="blog_title">Grit the power of passion and perserverance</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="blog_body">
					<p>by Angela Lee Duckworth - YouTube</p>
					<p>IQ is not the only difference between the best and worst students. Anyone can learn the material if they work hard and long enough.</p>
					<p>Grit is passion and perserverance for very long term goals, it's having stamina, sticking to your future day in day out for years and working hard to make that future a reality. It's living life life a marathon, not a sprint.</p>
					<p>Grittier people are more likely to succeed than just talented people.</p>
					<p>We've already learnt how to measure IQ when it comes to education but to succeed in life, we need more than the ability to learn quickly and easily. We need Grit.</p>
					<p>In every setting (millitary, spelling bee, teaching in tough neighborhoods, sales - who earns more money and their jobs) ask who is more successfull and why and who is more effective.</p>
					<p>Success is not predicted by social intelligence, good looks, physical health or IQ, a good signifier is Grit.</p>
					<p>Most shocking thing is how little we know about building grit in people. The best idea so far for growing Grit is the growth mindset by Dr. Carol Dweck from Stanford.</p>
					<p>Growth mindset is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, it can change with your effort.</p>
					<p>It's good to study the brain to learn how it handles challenges so as to understand that failure is not a permanent condition.</p>
					<p>We have to be willing to fail, to be wrong, to start over again with lessons learnt.</p>

					<h1 class="blog_title">The power of believing that you can improve</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="blog_body">
					<p>by Dr. Carol Dweck</p>
					<p>Instead of taking it as a fail, a good idea is to treat it as not yet so you can understand you're on a learning curve.</p>
					<p>Understand that your abilities can be developed and thus face challenges with a positive attitude of wanting to learn more. This is a growth mindset.</p>
					<p>Instead of being gripped in the tyranny of now, luxuriate in the power of yet.</p>
					<p>People with a fixed mindset run from an error instead of engaging with it like those with a growth mindset who believe that abilites can be developed and hence engage deeply. They process the errors, learn from it and correct it.</p>
					<p>It's sad that we are in a generation of young workers who cannot get through a day without an award.</p>
					<p>To to build the bridge to yet:</p>
					<p>1. Praise wisely - not praising intelligence or talent, that has failed. Praise the process the kids engage in. Their efforts, strategies, focus, perserverance and improvements. This creates hardy and resilient people.</p>
					<p>The word yet or not yet gives more confidence. It's better to give a path into the future that creates greater persistence.</p>
					<p>Every time we push out of our comfort zone to learn something new and difficult, the neurons in our brain form new, stronger connections, and over time we can get smarter.</p>
					<p>With effort and difficulty, the neurons make new connections, stronger connections and we get smarter.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="blog_body">
					<p>
						Feyman was a physicist "quantumelectrodynamics" and was a great
						explainer that infact that became his nickname.
					</p>
					<p>
						Teach what you're learning to somebody else becuase explaining helps
						you better understand a concept.
					</p>
					<p>
						A step by step process for doing this is called the Feyman's
						technique.
					</p>
					<p>
						Feyman's first principle is that you must not fool yourself and
						you're the easiest person to fool.
					</p>
					<p>The process has four steps:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Take a piece of paper and write the concept's name at the top.
						</li>
						<li>
							Explain the concept using simple language as if teaching it to
							someone else. Also work through examples and ensure you practice
							as well.
						</li>
						<li>
							Identify problem areas (those you're shaky on) then go back to the
							sources to review untill your understanding becomes solid.
						</li>
						<li>
							Look at your explanation and try to Identify any complicated terms
							(or convoluted language) and challenge yourself to simplify them
							into something easy to understand. Like you were explaining it to
							a kid by asking why all the time. Like why does this or that work.
							Like instead of just knowing a formula, know why it works.
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						This concept helps you understand where your knowledge is solid and
						pinpoints where it's shaky and needs to put in some extra work.

						Body Gestures that make you less attractive
					</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="blog_body">
					<p>Here are some body gestures that make you less attractive</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Crossing your arms - stop crossing your arms because it makes you
							look more intimidated, closed up and obviously nobody will want to
							talk to you because you seem less friendlier. It's like a
							universal sign of saying "Back Off".
						</li>
						<li>
							Looking Down - most people do this when they feel uncomfortable.
							This sends a message that you are insecure or shy even if that may
							not be the case. Instead of looking down look across the sight
							then back to eye contact.
						</li>
						<li>
							Weak Handshake - when you introduce yourself have firmness of
							handshake because it show you're confident. Powerful handshakes
							could even earn you respect.
						</li>
						<li>
							Covering your mouth - shows you're either lying or withholding
							something and people end up asking you to repeat yourself which
							even makes things awkward.
						</li>
						<li>
							Smiling awkwardly - only smile when something is funny because
							this ensures you'll not smiling awkwardly. If you must smile at
							all times, at least practice your smile on the mirror to know
							which smile looks good on you.

					<ol>
						<li>Not listening enough to others - people love to talk about themselves so always give others that chance and avoid talking too much about yourself then you can speak your piece after.</li>
						<li>Criticizing others too much - avoid always telling others what mistakes they are making even if you have the best intentions. Just measure the amount of critism and throw some compliments and encouragement in.</li>
						<li>Being so negative - this goes for those that always see the glass as half empty. Avoid always having a negative attitude as people will always want to walk away from negativity.</li>

					<h1 class="blog_title">Things intelligent people do.</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="blog_body">
					<ol>
						<li>Adapt easily to different environments - Intelligence is not only about gathering a lot of information or memorizing it but also about being able to easily adjust to new environments as it requires many cognitive processes such as perception, learning, memory and problem solving.</li>
						<li>Question everything - taking each opportunity to learn more about how the world works. According to a Harvard review CQ (Curiosity Quotient), EQ (Emotional Quotient) and IQ (Intelligence Quotient) determines you ability to manage complexity and information overload which is why employers often want those curious to learn as they are more motivated to seek answers and lean more. This also means they accumulate more knowledge along their life than those who only rely on their intelligence.</li>
						<li>Understand they don't know everything - be able to identify your strengths and your weaknesses. Admitting you don't know everything shows high levels of self awareness as well as metacognition.</li>
						<li>They seek knowledge - the co-relation between learning and intelligence can be explained by Neuroplasticity (The brain's ability to change or adapt by forming new neural connections throughout life). When you learn something new, your brain is creating electrochemical pathways to access that information. However, the key is repetition as it strengthens the pathways the neurons have created. The more pathways you create, the more fluid your intelligence will become.</li>
						<li>They get bored a lot - because you're excited about being in a new enviroment but then you're faced with setbacks that prevent you from engaging with it. Being bored though is necessary for creativity and intelligence. </li>
						<li>They doodle - can be in meeting when taking notes you find yourself doodling. Doodling is your brain's way of staying focused and also processing. Those who doodle tend to retain more information than those who don't.</li>
						<li>Self examination and reflection - this is mostly related to EQ which means you're more self-aware and introspective. You're more aware of your emotions, your needs and desires therefore likely to establish more meaningful relationships and achieve their goals.</li>
						<li>Remaining open - to different opportunities and enjoying learning new things. Studies have shown a co-relation between intelligence and openness and found the degree of openness can affect your fluid intelligence. So being open minded signals cognitive adaptability and flexibility which is what keeps you curious and ready to learn.</li>

					<h1 class="blog_title">9 Types of intelligence</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="blog_body">
					<p>
						The original types were seven but two more were added by Howard
						Gardener over the years.
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Visual-Spatial intelligence - Has to do with how well someone is
							at manoeuvring through space and visualizing things. These people
							are good at identifying charts and graphs and they are good map
							readers. They have a good sense of direction. Careers include:
							architecture, computer science and design. To cultivate this
							intelligence, take photography or drawing classes, draw mind maps
							of your plans or ideas, do puzzles and mazes for fun. Famous
							people with this intelligence include Steve Jobs.
						</li>
						<li>
							Linguistic verbal intelligence - Is all about words. This
							translates to great readers, writers and speakers. Generally these
							people can tell a good story and memorize words quickly and
							express their feelings easily to others. To cultivate this
							intelligence, write a journal, play word games like scrable and
							cross word puzzles, read more books and debate issues more often.
							Careers include: writers, public speakers, lawyers.
						</li>
						<li>
							Logical-Mathematical intelligence - Is about logical problem
							solving and number sense. People with this intelligence are
							obviously good at solving math problems and are strong conceptual
							thinkers. Think of scientists and mathematicians. Careers involve:
							Scientists, Computer Programmers, inventors. To cultivate this
							intelligence play log and pattern games like sudoku, find the
							pattern in a poem, develop a hypothesis, organize a collection.
							Famous people with this intelligence include Nicola Tesla and Bill
							Gates.
						</li>
						<li>
							Bodily-Kinesthetic intelligence - Is how well people can move
							through space. People with this intelligence have excellent
							control of how they move their bodies in space and high body
							awareness. Careers include: dancers, construction workers, actors,
							sculptors. These people have good eye-hand cordination. To
							cultivate this intelligence, indulge in physical activities,
							manipulate objects, build things. Famous people with this
							intelligence include: Michael Jordan and Michael jackson.
						</li>
						<li>
							Musical intelligence - Can you clap to the beat and sing in tune?
							People with above average musical intelligence can recognize tones
							and hear patterns in songs. They are drawn to both listening and
							creating songs. Careers include: DJ, band director, singer. To
							cultivate this intelligence, listen to music while studying,
							connect music to a lesson, write a short song. Famous people with
							this intelligence include Mozart and Alicia Keys.
						</li>
						<li>
							Interpersonal intelligence - Is about interpersonal or social
							skills. It's about being empathetic and good at understanding
							other peoples intentions and emotions. These people excel at group
							work and keeping the peace in organizations, they are excellent
							communicators and sensitive to other people's needs, they can also
							see other people's perspectives. Can you figure out what other
							people's body language means? Do you tend to know what people are
							thinking or feeling without having to ask? Careers include:
							politicians, teachers, social workers, counselors. To cultivate
							this intelligence, engage in group work, volunteer in community
							service, teach a class or a friend. Famous people with this
							intelligence include: Oprah, Dr. Phil and Mother Teressa.
						</li>
						<li>
							Intrapersonal intelligence - This is self awareness. It's about
							how good you are at reflecting on and being aware of your own
							mental and emotional state at any given time. These are the
							philosophers and the day dreamers. To cultivate this intelligence,
							keep a daily journal, read self-help books, imagine yourself in
							other people's shoes.
						</li>
						<li>
							Naturalistic intelligence - These are nature lovers. They are
							senstive to slight changes in their environment and gravitate to
							exploring nature. Careers involve, zoo keepers, conservationists.
							To cultivate this intelligence, keep a nature journal, start a
							small garden, go outside for everyday activities, keep a pet.
						</li>
						<li>
							Pedagogical intelligence - These are the effortless teachers.
							People who can instruct, facilitate and convey information to
							others. It's one thing to understand a topic, but it's a very
							different skill set to help other people understand that same
							topic. Famous people with this intelligence include: Budha.
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						Thinking you're strong in one intelligence may limit the effort you
						put into learning the others.
					</p>
					<p>
						Looking at skills and abilities as changeable through hard work and
						practice enables us to change those abilities. This is the growth
						mindset.
					</p>
					<p>
						When we think that our abilities are innate, it is less likely that
						we can improve.
					</p>
					<p>
						People have different ways of learning: visual, aural, read/write,
						kinesthetic.
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Understand you're not born socially handicapped - we are social beings. The reason you may not be so good at interactions, is that you haven't given your brain enough time to observe interactions and become fluent in all the patterns and rules. The human brain is actually very good at identifying patterns and rules when it comes to social interactions thus we can purely learn from observation. Things you have to pay attention to when having a conversation with someone include: body language, facial expressions, tonality, speed of talking, proximity, eye contact, etc. So just practice by interacting with more people no matter how the shallow the interaction might be. You can try the 100 people challenge where you interact with a 100 people for a span of 1 month. You can just say hi and that would also count as an interaction. Watching videos can help but the best way to learn is to do the talking in practice.</li>

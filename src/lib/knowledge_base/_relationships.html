        <div class="blog_body">
            <p>One day... Someone is going to come into your life and adore you for everything that you are. The way you speak, the way you eat, the way your stomach folds when you sit, and even the way you laught obnoxiously at little things. It will happen. Everybody will find their person. Just breathe.</p>
            <p>Nobody is easy to be with. We all suffer from something. So when you meet someone who is willing to stay committed to understanding you and actually wants to grow with you, don't let your ego and pride ruin it. Real is rare. Remember that.</p>
            <p>Stay single till you find someone that adds value to your life. Be with someone that helps you grow... otherwise it ain't really worth it.</p>
            <p>If we could look into each other's hearts and see the challenges each of us faces. I think we would treat each other with more love, kindness, compassion and patience.</p>
            <p>It's more satisfying to help someone feel loved than to seek love from others.</p>
            <p>Cut off fake people for real reasons, not real people for fake reasons.</p>
            <p>Seek relationships grounded in respect and appreciation.</p>
            <p>There's nothing more attractive than someone with passion for something, who looks at things positively and is always seeking to better themselves.</p>
            <p>Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. It can turn a meal into a feast, a house into a home, a stranger into a friend.</p>
            <p>Most people get married believing a myth that marriage is a beautiful box full of all the things they have longed for: companionship, intimacy, friendship etc. The truth is that marriage at the start is an empty box. You must put something in before you can take anything out. There is no love in marriage. There is no romance in marriage. You have to infuse it into marriage. A couple must learn the art and from the habit of giving, loving, serving, praising, of keeping the box full. If you take out more than you put it, the box will be empty.</p>
            <p>Until men and women start having honest conversations about who they truly are, what demons they battle with, where they lack, where they come from, and what they truly want, love will continue to be a temporary emotion. Honesty and communication is key.</p>
            <p>When you fully trust someone without any doubt, you finally get one of two results: a person for life or a lesson for life.</p>
            <p>Imagine dating a woman who prays for you, who is smarter than you that when you're in a fix all you do is say, "let me call my wife, I'm sure she'll come up with something."</p>
            <p>The pain of marrying the wrong person is worse than the present fear of not getting married. Take your time to fall in love, nurse your ambitions, groom your relationship. Because forever is too long to be unhappy. It's better to wait long than to marry the wrong person.</p>
            <p>Love psychologically means nothing to a man. Respect and honor though means a lot to all men.</p>
            <p>Get yourself into the best position you can before adding another person in your life coz you've got to take care of them. Work on your career, get yourself in the best financial position you get so you can take good care of your family and everybody else.</p>
            <p>untill a man heals he's toxic to every woman that loves him.</p>
            <p>In today's world, we are over connected but under related</p>
            <p>the quality of our lives is det by the quality of our relationships. If you don't get your relationships right you won't have happy and meaningful life.</p>
            <p>A marriage is supposed to make you more happy and more holy because ego and pride must die and you must be more committed.</p>
            <p>Figure out what help the other person needs.</p>
            <p>Everybody wants to be heard and seen. Give people the opportunity to do that and be genuinely interested rather than trying to be interesting and make them feel important.</p>
            <p>Authenticity and vulnerability is what connects us as humans</p>
            <p>Don't be in a relationship with someone you would never marry. It's a waste of time.</p>
            <p>You only receive attention from a heart that fears your absence.</p>
            <p>Find a way for your spouse to be your best friend, not just a lover.</p>
            <p>Dating and relationships should be about serving each other. In dating people do this quite easily but once in a relationship, they start to become lazy. Avoid being lazy. Serve each other with energy at all times.</p>

            <h1 class="blog_title">The 5 Needs of Man and Woman</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="blog_body">
            <p>He needs your love, your affirmation, your belief in him. He needs your companionship and your time. He needs you to be his one and only- sexually and with all your heart. He needs you to cheer him on, equipping him for the battles of life.</p>
            <p>She needs your love, heart and time. she needs you to be the one to encourage her and cheer her on and lead her spiritually. She needs you to be her soul mate, her best friend.</p>
            <p>Meeting your spouse's love needs is one of the most important responsibilites you have in your marriage.</p>
            <p>Meeting your spouse's love needs is a matter of keeping your vows. To love your husband, cherish your wife, to face good and bad hand in hand, together as one. When you meet the needs of your spouse, you're fulfilling your marriage vow. That's what the marriage covenant is about.</p>
            <p>Our culture does not recognize respect, or support the importance of the vows. But God does- as do the men and women who are choosing to live out biblical marriages.</p>
            <p>Meeting your spouse's love needs is what God calls you to do. It's a calling for husbands and wives to have the kind of sacrificial love that makes them willing to lay down their lives for each other. God wants husbands and wives to consider the needs of the other as more important than their own.</p>
            <p>Meeting your spouse's love needs results in a great marriage. When you focus on how to meet your spouse's needs, you become motivated to do what God is calling you to do. When a husband and wife do this wholeheartedly, each loving and focusing on meeting the legitimate needs of the other, the relationship is doubly strengthened.</p>
            <p>Neglecting to meet your spouse's love needs could cost you your marriage. You could end up losing him or her to another man or woman. Or to whatever affair your spouses believes will fill that need in his or her heart. Just like you must meet your spouse's need for food and water, you must also meet their emotional, physical, relational and spiritual needs. When you meet your spouse's needs, you guard your marriage against temptation.</p>
            <p>Our culture today does not really have a clear answer on how to have a great marriage. And just being Christian does not make a marriage great. Just showing up in church isn't going to build a healthy, biblical marriage. We must be more than hearers of the word; we must be doers of the word.(James 1:22...if you dont obey, you are only fooling yourself).</p>
            <p>Houses don't do well on sandy foundations. Neither do relationships. They must be built on the rock of Christ Jesus to not only start strong, but to also finish strong.</p>
            <p>Human nature is strange. We have different needs and this is most evident in areas like sexual needs, but it is true in other areas as well.</p>
            <p>Don't just assume your spouse wants what you want, and then act on that. Often we don't really know what our spouse's needs are thus can't possibly meet them effectively.</p>

            <h2 class="_heading2">Unconditional Love and acceptance.</h2>
            <p>This is what every one of us searches for as we risk letting other people get close to us.</p>
            <p>When we open our hearts to another person, our bottom-line desire is to be accepted and loved the way we are, warts and all. We want to drop the mask and be safe.</p>
            <p>No doubt many would expect the number one need for men to be sex and the number one need for women to be communication, but that was not what we found. Instead, as different as men and women can be, both agreed on this one truth: We all need to be loved unconditionally by our spouses</p>
            <p>For wives, unconditional love means she needs to be loved and received no matter what. For richer or for poorer. In sickness and in health. Unconditional love is the commitment that says, "I will stay with you no matter what. I will always love you. I will affirm you and support you." Acceptance means, "I will receive you even in the midst of tough times."</p>
            <p>We need to know that we are accepted even when we come up short, even when we can't see beyond our own pain and failures.</p>
            <p>There's usually those times of crisis. Times of unbearable stress. TImes when in your heart of hearts, you wonder whether your spouse will draw close to you and love you without question or whether he will turn his back and reject you.</p>
            <p>___I could tell by the tone of her voice that she was mine and I was hers and that we belonged to God. Even as I was saying all this, I was searching her eyes for her real response. What a relief I felt when I saw no panic, no fear. Not even disappointent. Instead, her eyes told me the same thing that her words did: "I'm sorry this happened to you. But it will be all right. We are going to be okay." Nothing had changed yet because of her response, I knew that I wasn't alone; and I knew that between God and my wife, I was secure.___</p>
            <p>As a man, the two roles we must fulfill are being a provider and a protector.</p>
            <p>When a wife God has given a man reminds him that she will always be there for him, that’s when he knows the power, real power, of unconditional love and acceptance</p>
            <p>Unconditional love starts with God. It is from Him that all unconditional love emanates.</p>
            <p>God loves us unconditionally. Completely. Without reservation. Unequivocally. Just as we are. No matter what.</p>
            <p>Unconditional love and acceptance despite our short comings and no matter what, changes lives. </p>
            <p>Every family struggles with hard times, broken promises, unmet expectations, financial setbacks, betrayals. When facing such difficulties, call on God's strength so that you and your husband can walk through the pain together and emerge the stronger for it, both individually and as a couple.</p>
            <p>Our love allows our spouse to be honest, thus establishing a comfortable environment for open communication.</p>
            <p>Our commitment must be true for bad times as well as good times.</p>
            <p>When we are unresponsive or neutral during hard times, it leads to the other feeling lonely and isolated.</p>
            <p class="title">What you can do to met your husband's needs</p>
            <p>Your response, initiative and connectiion to your husband are crucial to the health of your marriage and family.</p>
            <p>Standing with your husband in the good times and the bad is one of the primary elements of a great marriage. At times this means putting aside your needs in order to meet his, resisting your tendency to be selfish and self-protective. Lack of this leads to you two living like two immature children, each trying to get their own way and resenting the other person when you don't. You may still be married, but you will miss out on the joy of a great marriage.</p>
            <p>Husbands desperately need to know that you will accept then no matter what. Even when he fails or makes poor decisions, when he feels crummy about himself or disappoints you. Your inability or refusal to love will cripple him and tear him apart. Your unconditional love and acceptance will build him up and free him to go on.</p>
            <p>To do all this, we must remember unconditional love starts with God. Our ability to give costly love comes from God's unconditional love for us.</p>
            <p>As believers, we are able to start anew each day with God, repenting for sinful lapses and being assured of his forgiveness. Perhaps in a similar way we need a daily clearing away between husband and wife.</p>
            <p>Giving your husband the security of your unwavering love requires at least five elements: showing grace with his weakness, affirming him whenever you can, helping him feel safe, taking time to connect and studying your husband.</p>
            <p class="title">Show grace with his weakness.</p>
            <p>All of us need grace. But we need it most when we are truly aware that we don't deserve it- when we have failed, when we have made mistakes, when we have been selfish, when we have sinned.</p>
            <p>when you express grace to your husband in his areas of weakness and sin, you love him as Jesus loves him.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="blog_body">
            <h2 class="_heading2">#5 Physical Touch</h2>
            <p>Research on child development has concluded that babies who are held, hugged, and touched tenderly develop a healthier emotional life than those who are left for long periods of time without physical contanct. The same is true for the elderly.</p>
            <p>In nursing homes, those who receive touch have a more positive spirit and generally do better than those who are not touched.</p>
            <p>"We don't let people know the fact that we all like to be touched because we're afraid that people will misinterpret. So we sit back in loneliness and physical isolation."</p>
            <p>The body is made for touching.</p>
            <p>Tiny tactile receptors are located throughout the body. When those receptors are touched or pressed, nerves carry impulses to the brain, the brain interprets these impulses and we perceive that the thing that touched is warm, cold, hard or soft. It causes pain or pleasure. We may also interpret it as either loving or hostile touch.</p>
            <p>The tips of our fingers, tip of the tongue and tip of our nose are higly sensitive.</p>
            <p>Physical touch can make or break a relationship. It can communicate love or hate.</p>
            <p>For someone whose love language is physical touch, your touch will speak much more than the words "I love you" or "I hate you". Withold touches and you isolate and raise doubts about your love.</p>
            <p>When your body is touched, you are touched much more deeply than the mere physical contact. When someone withdraws from your body, they distance themselves from you emotionally.</p>
            <p>Learn from the person you are touching what they perceive as a loving touch.</p>
            <p>Physical touch is a poweful communicator of love. In a time of crisis, more than anything we need to feel loved. We can't always change events, but we can survive if we feel loved.</p>
            <p>Crises provide a unique opportunity for expressing love. Your tender touches are remembered long after the crisis has passed. Your failure to touch may also never be forgotten.</p>
            <p>A pat on the back, kiss on the cheek, a tender touch to the arm, holding hands and embracing are all dialects of the love language, physical touch.</p>
            <p>For some, physical touch is not a primary love language so they tend to stiffen or withdraw when touched.</p>
            <p>The purpose of love is to enhance the well-being or another, not to satisfy your own desires. Therefore, learning to speak another person's primary love language is the most effective way of loving others.</p>
            <p>Today's single adult lives in the cultural aftermath of the sexual revolution that began half a century ago. The revolution found its roots in the early 1900s' writings of Sigmund Freud, the father of psychoanalysis.</p>
            <p>Freud emphasized the effect of sex on behavior. According to him, the full and uninhibited satisfaction of all instinctual desires would create mental health and happiness.</p>
            <p>Once decade before the 1960s' sexual revolution explode, Erich Fromm, a student of Freud chose to oppose his teacher in his work The Art of Loving, he wrote, "The obvious clinical facts demonstrate that men and women who devote their lives to unrestricted sexual satisfaction do not attain happiness, and very often suffer from severe neurotic conflicts or symptoms. The complete satisfaction of all instictual need is not only not a basis for happiness, it does not even guarantee sanity."</p>
            <p>Piritim Sorokin, a leading sociologist of his day, predicted if Freud's ideas were applied to society, it would destroy the meaning of human sexuality.</p>
            <p>Glenn Stanton, a social research analyst says, "With the great divorce between marriage and sexuality, the dream of a fulfilling sex life is more elusive to more people than it has been at any time in our history." His conclussion: Sex does not need to be liberated, rather it simply needs to be confined to its proper and most productive domain.</p>
            <p>Decades of research show that this place is lifelong, monogamous marriage.</p>
            <p>The commonly held idea that cohabitation will lead to a healthier marriage has been shattered by numerous research projects. The studies have found that those who cohabit before marriage have substantially higher divorce rates than those who do not. Prof. Jan Stets of Washington State University concluded, "Cohabiting couples compared to married couples have less healthy relationships. They have lower relationship quality, lower stability, and a higher level of disagreements."</p>
            <p>The popular idea is that sex is a biological need on the same level as thirst. If thirsty, drink water. If hungry, eat food. If you have sexual desire, fulfill it.</p>
            <p>Professor Soronkin's prophecy has come true: Sex has been reduced to mere copulation.</p>
            <p>Sex is intimate and should be shared with someone to whom we have a deep commitment. When our sexual relationship is not exclusive, we feel violated.</p>
            <p>The cohaviting male is four times more likely to be unfaithful as the married man, and the cohabiting woman is eight times more likely to be unfaithful to her "lover" as a married woman.</p>
            <p>There is a reason why Christianity and most major world religions have a high regard for human sexuality, viewing it not as a biological drive on the level with thirst, but as a gift from God to be fully and freely expressed between a man and woman who are committed to each other by the covenant of marriage. All the sociological, anthropological, and psychological research of the past fifty years has validated this view of human sexuality.</p>
            <p>The single adult in contemporary society must make the choice between Freud and the facts: uninhibited sexual expression or reserving sexual intercourse for the one to whom you are willing to make a lifelong commitment. This is no minor choice. It affects your physical and emotional health, as well as sexual satisfaction, for years to come.</p>
            <p>The good news about the five love languages is that all of them can be learned. Thus, you can deepen all your relationships by learning and speaking a person's primary love language.</p>
            <p>Every individual is unique. We must not force our own love language on another person; rather we must learn to speak his / her love language.</p>
            <p>Becoming fluent in the love language of another requires you be sensitive to the desires of the other person. The time, place and manner in which you touch are all important.</p>
            <p>Timing is largely determined by the mood and desire of the other person.</p>
            <p>Often people communicate their mood by their body language - how close they are to you , or whether their arms are folded, for example.</p>
            <p>If you attempt to hug a person when he or she is angry, you will most likely be rebuffed. Anger is an emotion that pushes people away from each other.</p>
            <p>Physical touch can be more effective when celbrating a victory or when people are down on themselves because they have not lived up to their potential, physcal touch can communicate genuine love and concern.</p>
            <p>Physical touch has an appropriate time and place. To force physical touch in places where they are not comfortable is not an expression of love but of selfishness.</p>
            <p>A significant number of singles do experience abuse in dating relationships, particularly in cohabiting relationships. Sometimes even closest friends and family are not even aware of the abuse.</p>
            <p>Any positive words and expressions of physical affection which follow angry outbursts will always appear hollow... The human heart does not easily recover from such physical abuse.</p>
            <p>You are not serving the cause of love when you allow abusive behaviour to continue.</p>
            <p>Some are so desperate for emotional love that they allow themselves to be treated as sexual objects rather than persons. Sexual abuse over a period of time breeds bitterness, hatred and often depression. Sometimes such emotions erupt in violent behaviour.</p>

            <h2 class="_heading2">Discover you primary love language.</h2>
            <p>One of the things that sets man apart from animals is his ability to communicate by means of words. Language is distinctively human.</p>
            <p>Each of us has a primary love language and it's the one that speaks most deeply to us emotionally.</p>
            <p>1. Ask yourself: How you typically express love and appreciation to other people.</p>
            <p>At times what you do for other mostly like words of affirmation may be your primary love language because you wish for others to do the same for you.</p>
            <p>About 25 % of adults speak one love language but wish to receive another language.</p>
            <p>For the other 75%, the language they speak most often is the language they desire. They love in the manner they would like to be loved.</p>
            <p>2, Observe what you request of others.</p>
            <p>If you frequently ask for help with projects, acts of service maybe your love language.</p>
            <p>Our requests tend to indicate our emotional needs. Therefore, observing what you request of others may clearly reveal your primary love language.</p>
            <p>3. Listen to your complaints.</p>
            <p>Our complaints reveal our deep emotional hurts.</p>
            <p>The opposite of what hurts you is probably your love language.</p>
            <p>If you received love in that language, the hurt would go away and you would feel appreciated.</p>
            <p>4. Ask the right questions</p>
            <p>What do you like most about the person you're dating?</p>
            <p>What do they say that makes you desire to be with them?</p>
            <p>Your answer will be very enlightening.</p>
            <p>Other questions include:</p>
            <p>What would be an ideal spouse for you?</p>
            <p>If you could have the perfect mate, what would they be like?</p>
            <p>Your picture of a perfect mate should give you some idea of your primary love language.</p>
            <p>If not in a relationship, ask:</p>
            <p>What do I want most in a friendship?</p>
            <p>An ideal friend would ____.</p>
            <p>Your answer will probably reveal your primary love language.</p>
            <p>5. The love language profile.</p>
            <p>Discovering your own love language helps you understand why you feel more loved and appreciated by certain people than you do others.</p>
            <p>There is certainly satisfaction in receiving love, but there's also much satisfaction in giving love (maybe even more)</p>
            <p>To be an effective lover, learn how to discover other's primary love languages.</p>
            <p>How to discover other love language?</p>
            <p>1. Observe their expressions, complaints and requests.</p>
            <p>Observe how they express their love to other people.</p>
            <p>Ask yourself, "What do they complain about most often?"</p>
            <p>Notice what they request most often.</p>
            <p>2. Margo's Discovery: Don't be afraid to ask questions.</p>
            <p>If you wish to know what is going on inside the mind of someone else, then ask questions.</p>
            <p>The questions must be well chosen and must be expressions of genuine desire for information.</p>
            <p>Take the story of Margo asking her mom what she'd like most on her birthday. The mother replies with nothing being any better than spending a whole day with Margo and this reveals her love language is quality time.</p>
            <p>3. Helen's Discovery: Good gifts are different for everyone.</p>
            <p>You can use a statement such as: You've really done so much and I'd like to do something to show you how much I appreciate what you've done. What can I do?</p>
            <p>4. Experiment a little bit.</p>
            <p>Another to discover someone's love language is to try out different things to see what works.</p>
            <p>It takes time, effort and though to discover another person's primary love language.</p>
            <p>Learning to speak another person's primary love language is the key to communicating to them on an emotional level that you care about their well-being.</p>
            
            <h2 class="_heading2">chapter 9</h2>
            <p>Love has the power to remove barriers and bring family members closer together.</p>
            <p>Families were designed to be the basic caring unit of society.</p>

            <h2 class="_heading2">Love languages and your special someone.</h2>
            <p>Many singles have given up on dating. They find it to be road strewn with heartache, physical frustration, misunderstanding, and untold anxiety, all of which add up to a "why bother?" attitude. Yet for others, the very idea of not dating sounds unnatural.</p>
            <p>Dating today has many pitfalls but that doesn't mean the process itself is necessarily evil. On the contrary, it may be one of the most healthy and beneficial social systems in our entire society.</p>
            <p>The reason many singles have failed in the dating game is that they have never clearly understood their objectives.</p>
            <p>Many think of the purpose of dating as "to have a good time" to "to find a mate". In some general sense, we know that the end of all this may lead us to marriage, but we are not clear as to other specific objectives.</p>
            <p>1. Develop wholesome interactions with the opposite sex.</p>
            <p>One of the purposes of dating is to get to know member of the opposite sex and to learn to relate to them as individual people.</p>
            <p>Half of the world is made up of the opposite sex. If you fail to learn the art of building wholesome relationships with "the other half", you have immediately and considerably limited your horizons.</p>
            <p>Our differences are numerous, but our basic needs are the same.</p>
            <p>Serving people is life's highest calling. To serve people, we must know them - male and female.</p>
            <p>Relationships cannot be built without some kind of special interaction, today, dating provides the setting for such interaction.</p>
            <p>One of our chief stumbling blocks to healthy dating relationships is that we have trained to view each other as sex objects.</p>
            <p>Erick Fromm "What most people in our culture mean by being lovable is essentially a mixture between being popular and having sex appeal".</p>
            <p>With a proliferation of TV programmes and the internet as a lifestyle, the perception of others as sex objects has become deeply ingrained in our thinking.</p>
            <p>giving your attention to the wide array of pornographic materials that are now readily available anywhere there is an Internet connection make you often find yourself addicted to this impersonal, disconnected perception of members of the opposite sex. When this becomes a fixed perception, then one ceases in the truest sense to be human. He or she becomes like an animal playing with his toys or allowing one’s self to be a toy with which another animal plays.</p>
            <p>2. Learn about the person, personality and philosophy</p>
            <p>Dating provides an opportunity to break down the perceptions of each other that the world has built up, and to learn to see others as persons rather than objects.</p>
            <p>It is in dating that we can learn names, personalities, and philosophies. These are the qualities of personhood.</p>
            <p>The name - identifies us as a unique person. Personality reveals the nature of our uniquness. Philosophy reveals the values by which we live our lives. All these become more clear as we begin to interact more personally with each other.</p>
            <p>It is in dating that we discover evey woman has a mother and father, and so does every man. Know or unknown, living or dead, our parents have influenced us and thus profoundly affected who we are. We are all connected with our past. In the dating relationship, we have the potential for excavating these roots.</p>
            <p>Our society pushes us to live in cocoons of social media and lonely commutes. This isolation has brough us to growing levels of loneliness, emptiness and sometimes desperation. Dating is an acceptable way of breaking out of isolation and connecting with others.</p>
            <p>3. See our own strengths and weaknesses.</p>
            <p>Dating also helps in aiding one's own personality.</p>
            <p>All of us are in process. We ought to wear signs around our necks reading: "under construction."</p>
            <p>As we relate to others in the dating context, we begin to exhibit various personality traits. This provokes healthy self-analysis and brings greater self-understanding. We recognize that some traits are more desirable than others. We see our own strengths and weaknesses.</p>
            <p>The acknowledgement of a weakness is the first step toward growth.</p>
            <p>No one is perfect. Maturity is not flawlessness. However, we are never to be satisfied with our present status of development.</p>
            <p>What we dislike in others is often a weakness in our own lives.</p>
            <p>In getting to know others, you can write the things you intend to say or ask about their lives beforehand.</p>
            <p>Change takes effort, but it is effort well invested.</p>
            <p>4. Practice serving others.</p>
            <p>History is replete with examples of men and women who discovered that humanity's greatest contribution is in giving to others.</p>
            <p>True greatness is expressed in serving.</p>
            <p>This service however is Ministry serving not martyrdom (Poor ol' me. I have to do this service as a duty).</p>
            <p>Ministry is something we do for others, whereas martyrdom is something others bring upon us.</p>
            <p>Dating is always a two-way street. Certainly we receive something from the relationship, but we are also to be contributing to the life of the person we are dating.</p>
            <p>In dating, many a reserved fellow could be "drawn out" by the wise questions of a dating partner. Many a hothead could be calmed by the truth spoken in love.</p>
            <p>Genuine service demands that we speak the truth in love. We do not serve each other by avoiding one another's weaknessses.</p>
            <p>Empathetic listening is an awesome medication for the hurting heart.</p>
            <p>At times we are in lives of others just to serve them for a season, like when someone is grieving their lost parent.</p>
            <p>5. Discover the person we will marry.</p>
            <p>Dating is designed to help us gain a realistic idea of the kind of person we need as a marriage partner.</p>
            <p>Dating people with differing personalities gives us criteria for making wise judgements.</p>
            <p>Someone who has limited dating experience may, after marriage, be plagued with thoughts like, "What are other women / men like?" or "Would I have had a better marriage with another type of mate?" But the individual who looks back on a well-rounded social life before marriage is better equiped to answer these questions. He is not as likely to build a dream world, becuase experience has taught him that all of us are imperfect.</p>
            <p>Dating can be taken as a way of finding someone with whom we can live in harmony and fulfilment for the next fifty years. The variables are great.</p>
            <p>It's true that opposites attract, but opposites may also repel. This is why couples can be so attracted before marriage and so disillusioned afterwards.</p>
            <p>The reality is, the more similar we are, the fewer conflicts we will have.</p>
            <p>Similarity is especially important when it comes to the bigger issues of life: value, spirituality, morals, whether or not to have children, how many children to have and vocational goals.</p>
            <p>Dating provides the context for exploring answers to these questions and determining our suitability for marriage.</p>
            <p>An attitude of love should motivate you to want to relate to others as persons rather than objects, to develop your own personality so you can reach your potential for good in the world, and to serve your dating partner and seek to encourage that person to reach his / her potential.</p>
            <p>Learning to express love in a language your dating partner will understand is critical. When the dating partner feels loved, he or she is much more likely to be open to an authentic relationship.</p>
            <p>The nature of the "in love" experience is that it begins with the "tingles" and develops into an emotional obsession where the person is viewed through rose-colored glasses and appears to be perfect. This is one of the highest emotional experiences ever between two people. It is temporary - gone within two years. When off this emotional obsession, we begin to view each other in more realistic terms. We see each other's weaknesses as well as their strenghts. We realize they are not perfect. This is when the couple begins to feel like love is slipping away from them. Now they must be intentional in their behaviour.</p>
            <p>The "in love" stage of marriage requires little effort. "Falling in love" was not a conscious choice. Whatever we do in the "in love" state requires little discipline or conscious effor on our part. The long phone calls, money we spend travelling to see each other, gifts we give, and the work projects we do are nothing to us. As the instinctual nature of a bird dictates the building of a nest, so the instinctual nature of the "in love" experience pushes us along in our euphoria. But when the euphoria has run its course, we must take responsiblity for our behaviour. Love at this point, becomes a choice.</p>
            <p>At this stage, it's important to speak the other's primary love language so they continue to feel loved.</p>
            <p>The experience of "falling in love" is not a foundation for a happy marriage. It is highly possible to be "in love" with someone you should not marry.</p>
            <p>Mostly when dating, we feel "tingle" for each date. Some dissipate quickly and the relationship gets off the ground. On the other hand, the "tingles" may develop into the emotional obsession called "falling in love".</p>
            <p>None of this requires much effort or thought. All you have to do is show up, and the emotions take over.</p>
            <p>A marital relationship designed to last a lifetime requires more than these euphoric, obsessive feelings.</p>
            <p>6. A time to talk about the real stuff</p>
            <p>We must not allow the euphoria to bling us from seeing the glaring difference between us on the fundamental issues.</p>
            <p>If too far apart on the fundamental issues (value, morals, spirituality, social interests, vocational visions and the desire or lack of desire to have children), be wise enough to express appreciation for the contribution made to the other's life and then go separate ways.</p>
            <p>To marry in the height of the "in love" euphoria and ignore these more fundamental issues is to set one's self up for a painful and difficult marriage.</p>
            <p>6. A commitment to core beliefs</p>
            <p>Good marriages are built on a combination of emotional love and a common commitment to a core of beliefs about what is most important and what we wish to do with our lives.</p>
            <p>Speaking each other's primary love language creates the emotional climate where these beliefs can be fleshed out in daily life.</p>

            <h2 class="_heading2">Should love lead to marriage?</h2>
            <p>We can't relive the past but we can make the future very different.</p>
            <p>Worst assumption most people make is that the love relationship will continue after marriage without much (or any) effort. Mostly before marriage, most people speak each others primary love language and it's easy since it the focus of their attention.</p>
            <p>If romantic love leads to marriage, be sure to continue speaking your partner's love language and this takes work but it's worth the effort.</p>
            <p>Due to lack of understanding of the nature of love, most marriages end up in divorce.</p>
            <p>Without emotional love, our love tanks drain quickly and our differences become battlefields</p>
            <p><b><i>What most of us seek</i></b></p>
            <p>We all desire to love and be loved uniquely, and that leads most of us into a covenant marriage relationship.</p>
            <p>Despite the rise in divorce, cohabitation and unwanted parenthood, marraige remains an aspiration of the vast majority of men and women.</p>
            <p>About 93% of people rate "having a happy marriage" as either one of the most important or very important objectives.</p>
            <p>With this desire, however, there are realistic fears.</p>
            <p>If singles can understand the nature of love and how to express it effectively, they can have the "happy marriages" they desire.</p>
            <p>1. Apply the principles learnt in every dating relationship.</p>
            <p>2. Accept the thrill of the in-love obsession for what it is - exciting but temporary.</p>
            <p>3. Commit yourself to purposeful love expressed in the other person's primary love language.</p>
            <p>Singles also need to asses the other aspects of life that will help them make a wise decision about marriage.</p>

            <p><b><i>Seven common purposes of marriage</i></b></p>
            <p>Some of the purposes of marriage</p>
            <p>1. Companionship</p>
            <p>2. Sex</p>
            <p>3. Love</p>
            <p>4. To provide a home for children</p>
            <p>5. Social acceptance</p>
            <p>6. Economic advantage</p>
            <p>7. Security</p>
            <p>While these objectives can be accomplished outside of marriage, abundant research has indicated that married people are happier, healthier, and better off financially.</p>
            <p>The purpose of marriage though, runs deeper than these seven goals.</p>

            <p><b><i>A deeper purpose</i></b></p>
            <p>In the ancient biblical account of Creation, God says of Adam, “It is not good for the man to be alone.” God’s answer to man’s need was “I will make a helper suitable for him.” The Hebrew word for suitable literally means “faceto-face.” The picture is that God created one with whom man could have a face-to-face relationship.</p>
            <p>It speaks of that kind of in-depth, personal relationship whereby the two are united in an unbreakable union that satisfies the deepest longings of the human heart.</p>
            <p>Marriage is God's answer for humanity's deepest need - union of life with another.</p>
            <p>Indeed, that same ancient account of creation says of Adam and Eve, "They will become one flesh".</p>
            <p>Man's psychological history is replete with his desire for connection. Marriage is designed to be the most intimate of all human relationships.</p>
            <p>The couple shares life intellectually, emotionally, socially, physically and spiritually and they share life to such a degree that they become "one flesh".</p>
            <p>This does not mean couples lose their individuality, it means they have a deep sense of unity.</p>
            <p>This kind of union does not come without a deep enduring commitment.</p>
            <p>Marriage is not a contract to make sexual relationships legal. It is not merely a social institution to provide for the care of children. It is not merely a psychological clinic where we gain the emotional support we need. It is not a means of gaining social status or economic security. The ultimate purpose of marriage is not even achieved when it is the vehicle for love and companionship, as valuable as these are.</p>
            <p>The supreme purpose of marriage is the union of a man and woman at the deepest possible level and in all areas of life, which in turn brings the greatest possible sense of fulfillment to the couple and best serves the purposes of God for their lives.</p>
            <p>The act of getting married does not just give a couple this kind of unity. There is a difference between “being united” and “unity".</p>
            <p>If our goal is oneness, then the key question before marriage ought to be “What reasons do we have for believing that we can become one?” As we examine the intellectual, social, emotional, spiritual, and physical areas of life, what do we find? Do we hold enough in common in these areas to provide a foundation for unity?</p>
            <p>No house should be built without a suitable foundation. Likewise, no marriage should be initiated until the couple has explored their foundation.</p>
            <p>This means couples ought to spend time discussing each basic area of life in order to determine who they are.</p>
            <p class="title">Intellectual Unity</p>
            <p>To explore intellectual unity, you need to get very practical.</p>
            <p>Set aside specific dating time to discuss with each other the kind of books you read. This reveals something of your intellectual interest.</p>
            <p>If one doesn't read books, this is also revealing. reading newspapers regularly, reading magazines, TV shows they enjoy most, web sites they frequent.</p>
            <p>The answers to these questions indicate something of your intellectual interest.</p>
            <p>Grades in school and the amount of education each has should also be considered.</p>
            <p>It's not a must that you have the same areas of intellectual interests and it's not about perfection, but you ought to be able to communicate with each other on the same intellectual plane.</p>
            <p>Do you hold enough in common intellectually to have a basis for growth? This can be answered by attempting some growth exercises.</p>
            <p>Agree to read some books and spend some quality time discussing its concepts. Once in a while, read the headline article at your news website of choice and discuss its merits and implications. This reveals a great deal regarding your personal status and potential for future growth in intellectual intimacy.</p>
            <p class="title">Social Unity</p>
            <p>We are all social creatures, but our social interests will often differ greately.</p>
            <p>Games and sports interest, musical interests, recreational activities, parties and if so, what kind of parties. These are questions you can't afford not to answer.</p>
            <p>It's not a must to have the same social interests but you must have a foundation for unity. Hold enough in common that you can begin to grow together.</p>
            <p>Stretch yourself, go to things you haven't learnt to enjoy before, see if you can learn to enjoy some of the same things.</p>
            <p>If interests differ, ask yourself, if he never changes his present social interest, will I be happy to live with him the rest of my life?</p>
            <p>Can you write a descriptive paragraph about the kind of person you are? (about your personality). Discuss your self-concept as compared with how you appear to others.</p>
            <p>What do you as a potential problem area when you think of living life together? Can you make progress in overcoming these difficulties before marriage?</p>
            <p>Unresolved problems before marriage are often magnified after marriage.</p>
            <p>Persnalities don't have to be identical - this could make a pretty boring marriage. There should however, be a basic understanding of each other's personality and some idea of how you will relate to each other.</p>
            <p class="title">Emotional Unity</p>
            <p>The euphoria of the "in love" experience leads couples to feeling like they have genuine emotional intimacy. However, when the euphoria subsides, some couples discover that the foundation for emotional intimacy is extremely weak. They experience feelings of estrangement and distance.</p>
            <p>Emotional intimacy is that deep sense of being connected to one another. It is feeling loved, respected and appreciated, while at the same time seeking to reciprocate.</p>
            <p>The three ingredients of emotional unity: feeling loved, respect and appreciation.</p>
            <p>To feel loved is to have the sense that the other person genuinely cares about your well-being.</p>
            <p>Respect has to do with feeling that your potential spouse has positive regard for your personhood, intellect, abilites and personality. Respect begins with the attitude "I acknowledge that you are a creature of extreme worth. God has endowed you with certain abilities and emotions. Therefore I respect you as a person. I will not desecrate your worth by making critical remarks about your intellect, your judgement, or your logic. I will seek to understand you and grant you the freedom to think differently from the way I think and to experience emtions that I may not experience." Respect means that you give the other person the freedom to be an individual. You can tell if someone respects you by the way they treat your ideas, emotions and dreams.</p>
            <p>Appreciation is the innter sense that your partner values your contribution to the relationship. Each of us expends our energy and abilities in ways that benefit our relationship. To sense that our potential mate recognizes our efforts and appreciates them builds emotional intimacy between the two of us. Appreciation can look like, complimenting each other by saying things like "Thanks for calling me when you realized you were going to be late. It means a lot to me that you were thinking about me" or "Thanks for inviting me over for a meal. I know how much time and energy it takes to prepare a meal like this. I want you to know that I really appreciate your hard work, and the meal was delicious." If your thoughful acts go unnoticed, you may begin to feel unappreciated and emotional distance develops. Appreciation can also focus on abilities. "I love to hear you sing. You are so talented." or personality: "I am so grateful for your positive spirit about things. I know you were disappointed last night when I had to cancel our date, but it made me feel so much better when you told me you understood." Appreciation requires concentration. You must observe the other person's actions, words, attitudes and personality. Then take initiative to express your gratitude.</p>
            <p>If there's genuine love, respect and appreciation, then you will experience emotional unity.</p>
            <p>Share what makes you feel loved, resepected and appreciated.</p>
            <p class="title">Spiritual Unity</p>
            <p>Spiritual foundations are often the least excavated, even by couple who attend church regularly.</p>
            <p>Most couples find their greatest disappointment in marriage is that there is so little unity in this area. "we never pray together" or "church is like something we do individually. Even though we sit together, we never discuss what we experience".</p>
            <p>Too many premarital disucussions on religion deal only with church attendance and other external matters. They fail to grapple with the most basic and important issues.</p>
            <p>It's not just about church membership, charitable giving, or family tradition. It's about the spiritual foundation for marriage. Do you each agree there is an infinite, personal God? Do you know this God? These questions get to the heart of the matter.</p>
            <p>Are you encouraging each other in spiritual growth or is one gently but consistently pullin in the opposite direction?</p>
            <p>Spiritual foundations are the most important becuase they influence all other areas of life and unity.</p>
            <p class="title">Physical Unity</p>
            <p>Sexual unity can't be separated from emotional, spiritual and social unity. In fact, problems that develop in the sexual aspect of marriage almost always have their root in one of these other areas.</p>
            <p>Entering marriage without a physical examination is like playing Russian roulette. Then you have realistically face the implications of such a disease.</p>
            <p>Research indicates, "monogamous individuals committed to one lifetime partner are the most physicaly and emotionally satisfied people sexually."</p>
            <p>Most people who engage in sexual relationships outside of marriage do so out of a sincere desire to find intimacy. Unfortunately, sexual intercouse does not create intimacy and becomes itself a source of great pain physically and emotionally.</p>
            <p>Don't allow past failures to cause you to give up. Losing a batlle doesn't mean the war is lost. We can't retrace our steps and we can't undo the past. We can, however, chart our couse for the future. Don't excuse present behaviour for past failure. Confess your wrong and accept God's forgiveness.</p>
            <p class="title">Dealing with scars</p>
            <p>God forgives, but the natural results of our behaviors are not totally removed.</p>
            <p>Like a man slamming their car into a telephone pole due to anger, resulting in a broken arm. They have God's forgiveness before going to the hospital but the arm is still broken and the car is lost.</p>
            <p>In our moral behaviour, scars of failure are not totally removed by confession.</p>
            <p>Bibilical challenge is honesty in all things. Disclose fully what happened in your past.</p>
            <p>Marriage has no closets for skeletons. Your past is your past and can never be changed. Trust your partner to accept you as you are, not as he or she might with you were. If such acceptance cannot be experienced, then marriage should not be consummated. You must enter marriage with all the cards on the table.</p>
            <p>In addition to acceptance of your potential mate, accept yourself and overcome your own past. This may involve counselling and certainly exploration of spiritual healing. For the christian, understand what the scriptures say about our sexuality. One cannot come away from such a study without the impression that the bibilical view of sexual intercourse withing marriage is positive. It is wholesome, beautiful and ordained of God. An understading of truth will liberate you from negative attitudes.</p>
            <p>You are not destined to fail in marriage because of past failures. You will have roadblocks to overcome that would not be there if your had followed God's ideal.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="blog_body">
            <p>from Dr. Myles Munroe (YouTube)</p>
            <p>Salvation and marriage are one of the major decisions one makes in life.</p>
            <p>marriage decision is more important than buying a house, buying your first car.</p>
            <p>it's important to understand marriage otherwise you can buy an expensive house and have a horrible home that you can't even live in. Because you spent more money on the house than on the relationship.</p>
            <p>It's funny the government requires you to take a test for driving lessons for you to have a licence to drive a car on their roads and this can take months. But when it comes to marriage, getting a marriage license can even take 20 seconds.</p>
            <p>You're not required to read books on marriage but for driving you must learn for a while which shows many people know how to drive but they don't know how to live with someone. This is why most people have a broken heart.</p>

            <h1 class="blog_title">Principles for Male & Female Relationships</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="blog_body">
            <p>from Dr. Myles Munroe (YouTube) 31-05-2022</p>
            <p>Matt 19 - Jesus addresses divorce by answering the question but ignoring the issue.</p>
            <p>Jesus saw divorce as a symptom / sign not as a problem.</p>
            <p>Most marriages today end in divorce. But this is just a symptom, not the problem.</p>
            <p>A problem has to do with a cause, a symptom has to do with a sign. Divorce is therefore a sign that something is wrong. Like pain in the body is a sign or an indication that something is not right, not the problem itself.</p>
            <p>Divorce is worse than death. It comes from the greek word apostacian, which means to defect. Defection is mostly used in the army since you commit to fight for the country, so you commit not live but die for your country.</p>
            <p>Armies are not motivated by life, they are motivated by death.</p>
            <p>The problem is marriage is supposed to be the same way but we get into marriage for life not like in an army where the only thing that should separate us is death.</p>
            <p>Divorce is worse than death. Because it's like someone's dead but they keep coming back to life. Like after divorce you still see the person over and over again. It's the kind of death that's never closed.</p>
            <p>God does not join all people together. He only joins together those that qualify. Problem is who you join together. God joins together those who are like male and female from the begining.</p>
            <p>God only created one man from the soil and never went back to the soil again. The first one made was male. This means male is the foundation of humanity, and carries the weight of the whole building so more care needs to be given to the foundation. We first think about and understand the whole building before laying it's foundation and so God first considered everything it would take to carry the weight of the human family and concluded that male would be the foundation to carry all the weight of the family. So men are responsible for the family.</p>
            <p>As a man you have been designed with the ability to carry the entire weight of your family.</p>
            <p>Whatever something comes out of, sustatins it. And that's the source of the word father. means source and sustainer.</p>
            <p>This means male's source is God. But the female came from the male so the male is the source of the female and thus the father of the female. So males are made to sustain females.</p>
            <p>Jesus said, to have a good marriage, you gotta go back to the beginning. So we need to study male and female from the beginning if a marriage is to work.</p>
            <p>this clearly shows divorce ain't the problem, problem is the people being joined together. This is because you can't get a divorce unless you were married, you can't get married unless there's two individuals and there can't be two individuals unless there was one individual.</p>
            <p>THE FIRST MALE:</p>
            <p>1. had a clear self image. He knew he was the image of God. A man should not be trying to be like other people. </p>
            <p>A man should:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>know who he is.</li>
                <li>knows his self image.</li>
                <li>doesn't need anybody's approval to feel important.</li>
                <li>doesn't try to copy and imitate everbody's style.</li>
                <li>have his self confidence and self image in God. Not in any style or role model.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>2. He is in the presence of God. Love to be in the presence of God. Not one you need to drag to church or for devotion. Not a cool fool. All priests who worship are male. David, Abraham (built altars -  worship centers) and Moses (couldn't go without the presence of God)  were worshippers. Real men worship. Men can handle pressure.</p>
            <p>3. He is working and loves to work.</p>
            <p>4. He is a cultivator and can hence cultivate you. Meaning he can bring the best out of you, can advance you. Not a man who cannot improve you.</p>
            <p>5. He is a protector. (Gen 2:15). True males protect females. Not using their strenght to rape or abuse females or kids. He protects everything under his care. So when he gets home the family should be at peace coz dad is at home.</p>
            <p>6. He was given the word of God. So man was designed to be the teacher of the word and should keep the word of God. A man should know the word of God and should communicate it to his family. A real man knows the Bible back to front.</p>
            <p>So a man with all these qualities is the one who should not be alone. One who doesn't qualify can be alone.</p>
            <p>A man should have a plan for his life before the woman comes. Woman can't help you do nothing in your life.</p>
            <p>God formed man but made woman then brought her to Adam. God just made a helper, not a wife. God presented Eve. Adam made the choice to make her his wife. Coz he started talking, bone like my bone - structure, flesh of my flesh - no scales like other creatures. Adam then prophecies - for this cause should a man leave his father and mother and cling to his wife and the two shall become one flesh.</p>
            <p>Your salvation is more important coz it's eternal yet God cannot choose that for you. So there's no way God can make a choice for you. He just parades the women then the man chooses.</p>
            <p>READ OUT OF THE BIBLE NOT INTO THE BIBLE.</p>
            <p>every female has a man on the inside. Difference is their bodies. Their housing.</p>
            <p>man and woman are spirit and spirit has no gender.</p>
            <p>both have God's nature.</p>
            <p>both are eternal.</p>
            <p>both are sensual</p>
            <p>both are temples of the spirit.</p>
            <p>both must be managed by us.</p>
            <p>both have the nature, image and glory of God.</p>
            <p>So spiritually both are equal.</p>
            <p>Jesus left the church in the hands of a woman. (the church)</p>
            <p>THE FIRST FEMALE.</p>
            <p>1. Should be a helper to man. designed and equiped to help male fulfil his vision. Should not destroy the vision. Should not tell you or dictate how to run your life. A helper never runs the show. A marriage cannot have two heads (otherwise that's a monster) so woman should help the man achieve. Good women study their husbands and doesn't irritate of criticize. She keeps asking questions to find out dreams, desire of the man, to study the man's vision coz you can't help someone you don't know their assignment. Help the man become an ideal man. Holy Spirit comes along to help. He never takes over your life. He helps in what you are doing. Woman comes loaded with equipment to help, intuition, intelligence, wisdom, insight, sensitivity, power, incubation, annointing and comes into man's life to help. If you meet a man with a vision, don't create two visions in the house. Submit your vision to his. there should be no Division (two divisions in the same house). Family is business, so resources should be put in one place and be divided if need be.</p>
            <p>2. Should meet man in the garden. In the presence of God.</p>
            <p>3. Was not given the word directly. So she is supposed to be the recipient of the word through the male.</p>
            <p>4. Was designed to dominate with man.</p>
            <p>5. Should be the incubator. Whole body is incubation and gives life to everything. So be careful what you listen to and what you hear. so given gossip she multiplies  it, so ensure you receive the right stuff - don't talk to divorcees yet you're married coz it affects your marriage. YOU PRODUCE WHAT YOU KEEP LISTENING TO.</p>
            <p>6. Should be the producer. When given a sperm she produces a child, given a house, she produces a home, given groceries she produces a meal. </p>
            <p>7. Should be an encourager. A woman builds her house with her hands but tears it down with her mouth. Encourage and cheer up a man when he shares his vision with you. Make the home such a comfortable place that he can't wait to get home. A good woman makes it hard for the man to get out of the house and makes other women not to exist. Home should be a haven from all the pressure out there. Should have less of complaining.</p>
            <p>8. Should be the receiver. They always want what they see by design. But proverbs says, she doesn't cause her husband to go after spoil - even though she sees and wants, she doesn't pressure the man to go get it. </p>
            <p>9. Should be a naturer.</p>
            <p>10. Should give the commands after learning from the husband.</p>
            <p>11. She is the prophetess but male is the teacher. </p>
            <p>A female is an incubator so she receives information, expands it and gives it back to you. She never keeps anything. she can hold it for a while but eventually she'll give it back. </p>
            <p>In Joel the spirit will come everyone but the effect on each will be different. </p>
            <p>Young see visions, old have dreams, women will prophecy. </p>
            <p>Women are natural prophets. </p>
            <p>Tell your wife something if you wonna hear it again and that's prophecy especially when you give her your visions and she knows all the details too. </p>
            <p>So she can't allow you to be inconsistent.</p>
            <p>Male is the responsible head. Not meaning better but meaning responsible.</p>
            <p>NEEDS OF A MAN AND A WOMAN...</p>
            <p>MALE:</p>
            <p>(Not man becuase man is spirit and man needs God).</p>
            <p>1. sex - coz he's full of seed and that's his purpose, to produce seed so he's always ready. To carry seed and provide genes for the generations. Men don't want sex, they need it. A need is not a want. Problem is women are not the same so that creates a problem.</p>
            <p>FEMALE:</p>
            <p>1. Affection - Affection is not sex. She likes and enjoys sex but it's not her motivation. Sex is the result of affection to a woman. Show affection and you'll get your desire met. Men need to be sensitive. There's a time to touch her and there's a time to buy flowers and not touch her. A woman should fast and pray only after being told by the husband, then hurry back to the bed coz someone will provide his needs if you don't.</p>
            <p>Marriage is kept pure by understanding the other's needs.</p>
            <p>God -> Man -> Woman -> Marriage -> Family -> Community -> Nation -> Nations</p>
            <p>So to solve any issue we need to look at communities, families, marriage, woman, man then man should look to God. When we look to God (Malachi 4:6) he return the hearts of fathers to children.</p>
            <p>A woman is as good as the man makes them.</p>
            <p>Marriages are as good as the singles in it. Like an omelette, both eggs have to be good. Check to see for defects in character coz you're marry those defects and the relationship will be defective.</p>
            <p>Singleness is more important than marriage coz marriage is only as good as your singleness.</p>
            <p>In marriage, improve and your mate will improve.</p>
            <p>The more you know, the less the mistakes you make.</p>
            <p>For men. Read in pursuit of purpose then craft a vision for the next 30, 40 years. Understand what purpose and vision is otherwise you'll frustrate a woman. Talk to women, they're a walking library. Live with women in knowledge.</p>
            <p>Women. Learn and study men, let them educate you.</p>
            <p>Marriage is about meeting the other persons needs. You cannot meet a need you don't know.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="blog_body">
            <ol>
                <p>from Apostle Joshua Selman (YouTube) - 9_12_2021</p>
                <li>The man should be God fearing, not just born again.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The fear of God is different from having faith in God.</li>
                        <li>You can have faith in God but not fear God.</li>
                        <li>To be God fearing means to have reverence and respect for God, to submit to the ways of God, to have your life governed by the word of God as the final authority in all matters - not just some matters.</li>
                        <li>Decisions should be made in respect to this reference.</li>
                        <li>Have a reference upon which your life, ideologies and decisions come from.</li>
                        <li>Don't just come up with ideas about marriage or child upbringing.</li>
                        <li>Don't mix God's word with culture.</li>
                        <li>There's no bad people, intrinsically, every man is good.</li>
                        <li>EVERY MAN IS LIKE A VIDEO PLAYING OUT HIS MINDSET.</li>
                        <li>It's the thinking and ideology of a man that expresses him as bad. LIke a thief an be in the same body as a thief and transform to be a pastor while still in the same body.</li>
                        <li>concepts are what turn men into beasts.</li>

            <h1 class="blog_title">Before Dating</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="blog_body">
            <p>from Dr. Myles Munroe (YouTube) - 5_03_2022</p>
            <p>Things a man should have before dating:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>God's presence - The first things God gave a man is His presence (Eden), not a woman.</li>
                <li>Work Gen 2:15 - God told the man to work.</li>
                <li>Cultivate - bring out the best in everything around you and to make things fruitful. God does not give you a finished woman but gives you a woman to create what you want. She's a raw material you cultivate into the woman in your head and present her to yourself. Like Jesus has a wife Ecclesia Eph 5:25 is where we're told to love like Jesus. Like if she's overweight, wake her up and exercise with her. If you don't like her clothes, do shopping for her.</li>
                <li>Guard the garden -  a man should protect everything under his care. That's why we have a stronger bone mass.</li>
                <li>Word - Adam, don't touch the tree. The male is the only one who got the word of God. So he should teach the woman the word of God. A woman will always ask for knowledge and direction from the man. So the man needs to be more knowledgeable.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It's not good for a man with all these to be alone. Otherwise the man can be alone.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="blog_body">
            <p>from Dr. Myles Munroe (YouTube)</p>
            <p>as a man your family is your most sacred responsibility.</p>
            <p>the power of a man in a family is the key to the family.</p>
            <p>the word husband is from two words put together - House and Bond - so a husband is one who bonds the house together.</p>
            <p>a husband is like glue. You're supposed to glue the whole family together.</p>
            <p>as a husband you're a father and father comes from the word Abba which means source and sustainer.</p>
            <p>a father should sustain what he sources. Pay fees for your baby, feed her, clothe her, protect her, counsel her and provide for her.</p>
            <p>women are your baby too which makes it natural for men to call their wives, baby. Women came from man not from soil so the man is the father (source) of the woman.</p>
            <p>the family is like a business corporation. The father is the president. The wife is the vice president. The children are the board members. Neighbors are the clients.</p>
            <p>the man as the president to preside not control the house. The wife should be consulted as she's the vice president meaning you should not make decisions without asking for her advice. The children as the board should be informed about what you are doing and why you're doing it.</p>
            <p>for a house to be bond together, it has to a corporate effort.</p>
            <p>management of the home is the greatest test of a man's leadership. That's why Paul advices that to be a good minister you must first manage your own home well.</p>
            <p>there's men who want to build God's house but can't build theirs. They counsel other people's kids yet they're losing their own kids. They spend more time talking to other women more than they talk to their wives.</p>

            <h1 class="blog_title">Signs she is scared that she loves you</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="blog_body">
            <p>from Joyanima (YouTube)</p>
            <p>love often takes us by surprise, first we love someone just as a friend then out of no where we have deep feelings for them.</p>
            <p>when girls are in love, they try to hide in order to protect themselves which makes it even harder.</p>
            <p>signs she loves you but is scared of commitment:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>She is vulnerable around you - she lets her walls down for you because she knows that you're not going to hurt her and use these weakness against her but also is she gets a little scared and puts those walls back up, you need to be there for her till she lets them down again.</li>
                <li>She asks for your opinion - she is independent but she wants to know what you think. She wants you to know that you're part of her family and your opinion matters to her. Like what dress should she wear, should she take coffee or tea? These question show chances she has feeling for you.</li>
                <li>She can read your mind - only someone so much in love with you can know what you're thinking. You can walk into a room and they will know that you've had a bad day at work. She understands when you're feeling down or when you have a need to celebrate something. Intuition of girls is really incredible which might lead her to fearing commitment because she knows when you are not 100% committed to her.</li>
                <li>She's scared of losing you - if she loves you, she's most definitely afraid to lose you. Even if she doesn't know she's in love with you yet, she's afraid of losing you. She can distance herself so you need to show her she should not be afraid that she might lose you because you're not going anywhere.</li>
                <li>She tells you what she likes about you - she will be open and very honest. You just need to observe these things and pick them up. Like she might be out for dinner and be like, I like how you're dressing this evening. So pay attention to the things she says she likes about you.</li>
                <li>She sends you songs - this one is romantic since it's boys who used to make tapes for girls. Might be a song she heard on the radio and started to think about you.</li>
                <li>Her friends know about you - girls tell each other nearly everything when it comes to the boys they love. They normally don't say anything till they really know they like him.</li>
                <li>She only flirts with you over text - this shows she's afraid of being vulnerable with you in person. You need to flirt with her a bit in person so she knows you feel the same about her and increase her trust in you.</li>
                <li>Read her body language - take in her body language. Is she displaying the caring, flirting body language. Does she have her hand on your leg, is there direct eye contact? These are signs she might love you but is afraid to open up to you.</li>
                <li>she asks about your life - when you love someone and care about them, you love to ask everything about their life. She might even ask about other girlfriends so she knows where she fits in your life.</li>
                <li>She says sorry a lot - being nervous and shy is very common when you have feelings for someone but you're not sure if they feel the same way. A sign of being nervous and shy is saying sorry a lot.</li>
                <li>She takes care of you - she might buy you a cup of coffee, cook something nice when you visit and not letting you lift a finger. This shows she wants more, so you should tell her how you feel to bring about the commitment.</li>
                <li>She bumps into you - if she likes you she will find ways to bump into you. Like you might start seeing her in places you never thought you'd see her.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>Thinks she can change the man - It's wise to look at the career potential of a man, potential to grow as a leader and father. But when it comes to spirituality, look at the maturity of the brother that is present right now. Many girls kindness might be used against them when they begin to think they can take an unbelieving man and make him a godly husband. We only becoming good christians by the power of the Holy Spirit not just because of another person's will or wish. When looking for a husband, look at a man as he is right now not as what he could become someday.</li>
                <li>Never plant seeds of doubt about your loyalty - a woman should not keep waiting for a man not pursuing her, she should be open to other men but this should not be verbalized as it would challenge a brother to pursue you faster. It will show you're not that interested in him and that he should move on. Competition doesn't motivate a man in relationships, loyalty motivates him. A man's heart craves exclusivity with a woman. A man wishes for loyalty in his woman, if in question about her loyalty he won't commit long term to the woman till the questions are thoroughly answered. Ruth 1:16-17 describes the kind of loyalty a man needs. Ruth 2:11 is Boaz seeing a woman with the quality of loyalty that makes him think highly of her. Don't do anything that will plant seeds of doubt about your loyalty to a man.</li>
                <li>Never expect less of him than what you know the bible requires of him - you don't need to put pressure on a man to be more than he is because every christian man is under the requirements of the bible about him. Dont make demands of a man, but do expect him to honor the Bible's demands on him. Never expect less of a man than you know he's capable of. When a guy know you would never waste your time with a godless man, he will feel respected by you when you give him your time because he will know you see him as a godly man who has a heart to please Jesus. Notice how the Proverbs 31 woman chose a man worthy of her respect. In love, never settle for a man who is settling for less than God's best for himself.</li>

            <h1 class="blog_title">3 Steps a man should take when he likes a woman</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="blog_body">
            <p>from ApplyGodsWord.com (YouTube)</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Pray for her - this does not mean necessarily praying to obtain her. First step should not be to ask God to give her to you. It's better to ask God to lead both of you to "the one" He has for you both. Prayer is supposed to be less about God knowing what our will is and then doing it. Instead it's more about us knowing what God's will is and then doing it through the strength he gives. Ask God to lead the woman to the right man even if that's not you. Ask God to lead you to the right woman even if it's not her. Ask God for willingness to accept His will no matter what it is.</li>
                <li>Relate to her - this the step many men overlook. The first words should not be you asking her to go on a date. Christian women are usually very guarded about relationships. Relating to a woman gives her more information about you. When you ask a woman out but she has doubts about you, her default answer is no. By showing her you have things in common with her, you're giving her a reason to give you a chance. Relating with her also gives you the chance to gauge whether or not God is leading you to pursue her in a more intentional way. For some there's need for a long relating season to make friendship before dating. For some you may just need a few days of messaging or phone calls or going on a date to learn more. See if you two relate to each other before you decide to go all in and pursue her.</li>
                <li>Pursue her - how a man pursues a woman should be true of his personality. There's no rigid blueprint about how a man should pursue a woman because the bible doesn't do that and men are different. Other might need to start with inviting her over to a group outing with friends. Some men might prefer a date with a long talk where they lay down their intentions and goals for the period of courting. Other men might prefer the old fashion way, invite her to a couple of dates then ask if she would like to be in an official dating relationship. There's no command in the Bible that a man should pursue a woman. But in the Bible, husbands are called to lead their wives and lay their lives down for her as Christ did for the church. A man should show some leadership qualities when dating by him pursuing the woman because this is good evidence he will be a good leader even in marriage. A passive man in singleness and dating will be a passive man in marriage too.</li>

            <h1 class="blog_title">Compromise of Porn</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="blog_body">
            <p>John 8:31-38 - truly my disciples if you remain faithful to my teachings. 32. And you will know the truth and the truth will set you free. </p>
            <p>We have to tell the real truth as it is otherwise the enemy wins in our silence and obscutiry.</p>
            <p>It's about being set free not just feeling better.</p>
            <p>v34 - everyone who sins is a slave to sin.</p>
            <p>There's believers who depsite all the religious rituals still struggle with secret sins.</p>
            <p>v36 - if the son sets you free, you will be free indeed. v37 - there's room in your hearts for my message.</p>
            <p>There must be room for the truth in our hearts. We need to release the pain, the hurt, the ideas and opinions because freedom is what we really need.</p>
            <p>So the question is who is the truth - It's Jesus. (John 14:6 - Jesus told him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one can come to the Father excpet through me.")</p>
            <p>So John 8:32 could be read as, And you will know Jesus and Jesus will set you free.</p>
            <p>1. The truth (Jesus) Requires the truth (My Real Story).</p>
            <p>So the first step is to tell the whole truth as it is.</p>
            <p>The enemy uses this to keep you in shame, guilt, doubt and to have a secret thing that you just know how to do when you're stressed, or to release yourself off of anxiety.</p>
            <p>Porn is either affecting you and you don't know it or it's affecting the people around you and you don't know it.</p>
            <p>64% men and 15% women who are professing christians admitted to viewing porn every month.</p>
            <p>Men are more vulnerable but the number of women continues to increase and it mostly starts with comparison, insecurity or curiosity (how to do better to please the man).</p>
            <p>7 out of 10 men view porn consistently so that goes to explain why they treat people the way they do.</p>

            <h2 class="_heading2">Origin of porn</h2>
            <p>Porn can be trace back to 1879 in the ruins of Pompe where they found erotic paintings and pictures of various sexual acts that could cause sexual arousal.</p>
            <p>Porn was present in the biblical times.</p>
            <p>Porn in the bible can be traced using the words Pornea and graphy. The greek word pornea appears so many times in the new testament.</p>
            <p>Pornea is the word that give birth to words like prostitute, pornography. It means prostitution, whoredom, fornication, adultery or sexual immorality.</p>
            <p>It's mostly used in the bible for anything that's perversed or wicked (wicked means things that are turned).</p>
            
            <p>This thing even affected some women and men of God in the Bible.</p>
            <p>People like David, Solomon and Samson.</p>
            <p>Samson was strong and a judge of Israel and devoted his life to God like most of us believers do.</p>
            <p>Judges 16:1-3 - this is a man with strength and success beyond measure but still has an aquilis hill of sexual perversion.</p>
            <p>From Judges 14 we can see how all this betrayal from Samson's bride comes to play to leading him to laying with a prostitute.</p>
            <p>The enemy uses what you deal with secretely to pull you back. Like Samson trying to still walk in the strenght and might God has given him but still struggling with the things that pull him back.</p>
            <p>So most of the time we act like there's things that God is doing in our lives but we're brought down by these secret sins that we're still doing in the middle of the night - Like Samson waking up in the middle of the night.</p>
            <p>The thing is if we don't deal and talk about porn in church we're just be left with dealing with the consequences of porn in the church.</p>
            <p>Sexual sin is deceptive and does not look like what it really is - especially because it always over promises but under delivers. Like how it makes us feel good and gets us to the climax but leaves us later on to our demises.</p>
            <p>Take the example of how the ancient eskamos caught a wolf. Spread fresh blood and cover it with layers of ice so the wolf with a kin sense of smell comes to lick and bleeds till it starts licking it's blood unbenounce and eventually it drops dead.</p>
            <p>Sexual sin is the only sin we commit against ourselves. So we think it's not harming any other person but yes it's hurting the most important person and that's you.</p>
            <p>1. Porn gradually lets you kill you.</p>
            <p>James 1:14 - Temptation comes from our own desires, which entice us and drag us away.</p>
            <p>So it's not anybody else's fault that you're attracted to these things, it's in you somewhere.</p>
            <p>Like if you have no desire for some foods, they could even disgust you but foods that you like, the only way you can be enticed is if there's a seed of it inside of you and there's already a sin of that in all of us.</p>
            <p>2. Porn is always rooted in some unhealed pain.</p>
            <p>Porn is trying is mostly used to fulfill a pain or void that cannot be fulfilled by it and that's why you have to go back again and again to it. Like lemonade when thirsty instead of water.</p>
            <p>Funny thing is that there's variety of color and size so instead of doing what we're supposed to do and finding out who we are in our identity in Christ, we spend lots of time beings obsessed with images and varieties.</p>
            <p>The other thing is we don't even feel like doing what we're good at, just feel like satisfying the desires of our flesh at the moment and this goes on and on for years.</p>
            <p>When you start down this path, the flesh is never satisfied so it always wants to keep going.</p>
            <p>1 Thesalonians 4:3 - God's will is for you to be holy, so saty away from all sexual sin.</p>
            <p>Porn becomes habitual and with time if we don't become accountable and don't talk about it with someone that can walk with us, we tend to hand around the wrong company or friends that do the same so we now end up having accountability and community in the wrong place.</p>
            <p>Porn ends up robbing you. At times it ends up being that the visual is no longer enough.</p>
            <p>Some void can come from the void and death spoken to us by our parents or friends or when people make fun of us.</p>
            <p>All it takes is a bound person to meet the right opportunity and they meet their demise and at times we don't even recognize that demise.</p>
            <p>Samson is so comfortable in his delusion that he doesn't even realize he's compromised.</p>
            <p>Porn makes you think it's free and not harmful to anybody else. last part is promise so you are giving up the promise God gave over you life. The children God gave you, destiny and freedom Christ gave you.</p>

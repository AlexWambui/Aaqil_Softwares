						The foreign exchange market, which is usually known as “forex” or
						“FX,” is the largest financial market in the world.
					</p>
					<p>Forex allows one to trade currencies.</p>
                                        <p>The FX market is a global, decentralized market where the world’s currencies change hands.</p>
                                        <p>Exchange rates change by the second so the market is constantly in flux.</p>
					<p>
						If you think one currency will be stronger versus the other, and you
						end up correct, then you can make a profit.
					</p>
					<p>
						An exchange rate is the relative price of two currencies from two
						different countries.
					</p>
					<p>
						Take an example of visiting a foreign country, while at the airport
						you visit a booth to change say your dollars to Japanese Yen, If you
						have one dollar, then you have 100 yen after the exchange and you
						might as well call yourself rich. When you do this, you've
						essentially participated in the forex market. You've exchanged one
						currency for another.
					</p>
					<p>
						Or in forex trading terms, assuming you’re an American visiting
						Japan, you’ve sold dollars and bought yen.
					</p>
					<p>
						Before you fly back home, you stop by the currency exchange booth to
						exchange the yen that you miraculously have remaining (Tokyo is
						expensive!) and notice the exchange rates have changed.
					</p>
					<p>
						It’s these changes in the exchange rates that allow you to make
						money in the foreign exchange market.
					</p>

                                        <p>most of the currency transactions that occur in the global foreign exchange market are bought (and sold) for speculative reasons.</p>
                                        <p>Currency traders (also known as currency speculators) buy currencies hoping that they will be able to sell them at a higher price in the future.</p>
                                        <p>The largest stock market in the world, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), trades a volume of about $22.4 billion each day.</p>
                                        <p>the foreign exchange market looks absolutely ginormous with its $6.6 TRILLION a day trade volume.</p>

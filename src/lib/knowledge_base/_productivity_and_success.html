            <p>The difference between school and life is that while school will reward you for your memory, life will reward you for your creativity and ability to solve problems.</p>
            <p>Don't be entitled when you're at the top of your calss. When you finally graduate, the reace goes back to zero and the rules of the game change. Grades, medals and awards hardly matter when the rubber finally meets the road. Character and attitude become the standard.</p>
            <p>Don't fear failure. Fear being in the exact same place next year as you are today.</p>
            <p>The hustle brings the dollar. The experience brings the knowledge. The persistence brings success.</p>
            <p>Don't spend your capital competing with people who are spending their profit.</p>
            <p>A goal without a plan is just a wish.</p>
            <p>Study while others are sleeping. Decide while others are delaying. Prepare while others are daydreaming. Begin while others are procrastinating. Work while others are wishing. Save while others are wasting. Listen while others are talking. Smile while others are frowning. Persist while others are quitting.</p>
            <p>Consistency will help you build competence. Competence will help your build your confidence. Confidence will increase your conviction. Conviction will help you close more customers. Customers will help you grow your company.</p>
            <p>Before celebrating results, ensure you can reproduce them. Ensure you can produce the same result again.</p>
            <p>Do 3 - 5 things each day towards your goal. In 1 year, you'll be at a totally different destination, in 3 years, you'll totally have a huge distinction, in 5 to 10 years, life won't be the same.</p>
            <p>Have no limit on personal development. It's not how much you're growing, it's how much you're not growing.</p>
            <p>The rich have: FInancial IQ -> (Courage, Creativity, Money knowledge) -> Skills -> Assets. The poor have: School -> Specialization -> Job Security -> Retire with benefits.</p>
            <p>Morning routine: make bed, hydrate or coffee, read the bible and journal, pray, exercise, hydrate, breakfast, shower & skincare, plan for the day.</p>
            <p>to be good at communicating, start speaking more often, even if it's not that well, with time you'll get better. progress develops confidence. Just start.</p>
            <p>we all need the advice and wisdom of mentors who can enlighten our path.</p>
            <p>You miss 100% of the shots you don't take. "Hockey Hall of Famer Wayne Gretzky"</p>
            <p>Ambition is a powerful force. It can drive you to reach unimaginable heights of success â€” but it can also be your greatest downfall, leading to stress, burnout and a disconnected personal life.</p>
            <p>FOCUS - Focus One Course Unitll Success.</p>
            <p>customers, employees and investors are people. If you don't understand people, you don't understand business.</p>
            <p>People don't info, they have an ambudance of that. They need inspiration. The toughest person to lead is yourself. Best leaders come from a crockpot, not a microwave. There's great power in a good compliment.</p>
            <p>take action, have a mentor instead of wasting time trying to learn on your own, be consistent.</p>
            <p>When you can't control what's happening to you, control how you respond to it.</p>
            <p>It's no longer about GPA's and test scores but about being flexible in thinking, ability to adapt to changes, thinking before speaking or acting, reading people in situations.</p>
            <p>Instead of: NO, because - Change your thought process to: YES, if - especially in business and marketting.</p>
            <p>Learn from someone doing what you want to learn to do.</p>
            <p>There's 3 choices: Give up, give in or give it all you got.</p>
            <p>Have a conscious hierachy of goals.</p>
            <p>You can choose to be the light at the end of the tunnel or be the light that lights up the whole tunnel.</p>
            <p>The more you learn the more you're able to make decision about the direction of your life.</p>
            <p>Ask yourself how far you can go?</p>
            <p>You influence people whether you realize it or not.</p>
            <p>Growth and comfort cannot co-exist.</p>
            <p>Learn to think on paper.</p>
            <p>We have many decisions to make so it makes sense to have many advisers.</p>
            <p>Build a  business that can work without you being present. This leaves you as just the owner and also an investor but your presence is not necessary. Build middle and top management and appoint Managers and CEOs.</p>
            <p>John D. Rockefeller made the education system in 1903 because he wanted a nation of workers, not thinkers.</p>
            <p>Don't be stuck in the Knowing-Doing trap. Go ahead and do what you're learning. It's easy and comfortable to keep consuming without ever taking action. Learn one thing then do it and practice it before moving on to the next thing.</p>
            <p>In the beginning it usually hard work, but it's got to grow into heart work. Provide value and solve problems, advertise and have an exponential growth in your assets.</p>
            <p>Learn people's names. Get good at sales (You're either pursuading or being pursuaded). Be obsessed with the value of time (Continually think what you're worth as you do the things towards your goal.).</p>
            <p>It only takes a day to be born, to marry, to be burried, to make or have kids. Design your days for what you want to accomplish.</p>
            <p>Leverage artificial deadlines in your schedules. If you allocate a whole day for a task, you'll take the whole day to complete it. Allocate 30 minutes and you might as well just 30 minutes to complete the task.</p>
            <p>Invest in Unit trusts like money market funds that earn you upto 9-11% p.a.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Manage your time - You're not overwhelmed, you're unorganized. [Wake up earlier, Create a to-do list, Set deadlines, Stick to your schedule].</li>
                <li>Stop looking for a new job, city or partner. Make something out of your current situation first.</li>
                <li>Focus on one thing - everybody wants results but nobody wants to stay focused. The gap between your current life and the life you want is called focus. Focus 100% on one thing instead of doing 5 things with 20% focus each.</li>
                <li>Make gradual improvements because over time, they lead to big changes - start by reading one page, writing one paragraph, doing one workout. Then focus on getting 1% better everyday.</li>
                <li>Instead of chasing motivation, be disciplined - stay consistent, meet your deadlines, find an accountability partner. Long-term discipline and consistency are far more important than short term intensity.</li>

            <h1 class="blog_title">5 Basic Fundamentals of Life and Success</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="blog_body">
            <p class="title">29-02-22 by Jim Rohn - YouTube</p>
            <h2>5 Major pieces to the life puzzle.</h2>
            <p>Success is not abuot doing extraordinary things. Success is about doing ordinary things extraordinarily well.</p>
            <p>Poor and rich people talk but it seems like rich people talk better.</p>
            <p>Learning to speak is called survival, learning to speak well is called success.</p>
            
            <h3 class="_heading3">1. Philosophy</h3>
            <p>Philosophy in very simple terms is what you know and what you know greatly affects how your life works out.</p>
            <p>What you don't know also greatly affects how your life works out.</p>
            <p>Something important to do with what you know is to weigh it. Weight everything before you do it, before you buy it and before you try it.</p>
            <p>Everything you do is either major or minor towards your future. Weighing everything helps you not allocate major time or energy on minor things or minor energy and time on major things.</p>
            <p>Weighing everything is the reason we have sermons, songs, lyrics, lectures, seminars, conversations, professors and teachers, debates.</p>
            <p>So we get information -> we weight it -> then we come to conclussions about values.</p>
            <p>Poor thinking habits keep most people poor. Most people work hard but they don't think hard.</p>
            <p>If you really want to help somebody change their life, you have to start changing their mind, change their philosophy, change how they think.</p>
            <p>Motivation only won't do it. Because if you motivate an idiot you'll just end up with a motivated idiot.</p>
            <p>If you don't keep up the learning process, a lot of values become fuzzy, if you don't kwwp trying to perceive what's important, what's not important, and then start spending major effort on minor things. So keep learning, at least 1 to 2 books in a week.</p>
            <p>Learning helps to keep up the flow of ideas that can help refine your business and decisions and thus help in coming to better conclussions.</p>
            <p>Learning helps avoid making errors in your judgment. Like what to do or not do with your money.</p>
            <p>It's really important what you do when you have so little.</p>
            <p><b>Life is accumulative. Our erros accumulate into what we don't get or our wise decisions accumulate into what we do get.</b></p>
            <p>The key is to catch and correct the erros as quick and as early as possible.</p>
            <p>Wherever you hear the good information, that the right time to start fixing it.</p>
            <p>You can't do what you don't know, but the key is to keep learning so that good ideas keep occurring to you now that you can do more wise things.</p>
            <p>Keep up the reading, conversations, listening to lectures, going through information.</p>

            <h3 class="_heading3">2. Attitude</h3>
            <p>Philosophy determines attitude.</p>
            <p>Attitude is simple how you feel.</p>
            <p>First, what you know sets the sail of your life. Now how you feel starting taking you there.</p>
            <p>Attitude is by choice. You can choose to come early or late to work and work hard or not on your job.</p>
            <p>Now to make wise choices, we need educated attitudes.</p>
            <p>Emotions must go to school to learn where the values are.</p>
            <p>Attitude is a matter of educated choice.</p>
            <p>How we feel greatly determines how our life works out. It's how you feel about the past (use the past as a school, not as a threat to your life), how you feel about the future (two ways to face the future: anticipation and apprehesion. Most people face the future with apprehension but don't have their own future well designed. How you feel about the future greatly determines what you do. If you have no set goals, you take uncertain steps. Set goals, write them down, design your future in a journal even though at times it changes with time.), how you feel about each other - about society and the community and the country. If you want to do well, it takes all of us to help each of us do well. You can't succeed by yourself, we need each other's collective ideas, participation in the market place and society. Then how you feel about yourself - self-esteem. Realize that you've got the brains, the talent and all you need is instruction, and some coaching, some help, advice, experience. If you're headed down a road, hopefully somebody has already been down that road where the bridge is out. Learn from other people's experience. Self esteem primarily comes from engaging in the disciplines that lead to value. To bring value from potential we need the discipline.</p>

             <h3 class="_heading3">3. Activity</h3>
             <p>Activity is what you do. Success is doing.</p>
             <p>Major part of the value of our life is left to our own mental genius.</p>
             <p>You've got to decide what you want to become then simply start doing it, engaging in the disciplines.</p>
             <p>Don't rest too long. Make rest a necessity, not an objective.</p>
             <p>The objective of life is not to rest, the objective of life is to accomplish. To growth, full growth, full accomplishment, test the outer limits of you abilities, see all that you can do with your brain, talent, gifts and skills.</p>
             <p>If you make rest an objective, you start falling into the average syndrome.</p>
             <p>Rest only enough to gather strength.</p>
             <p>Whatever you hand findeth to do, do it with all your might.</p>
             <p>So how hard should you work, as hard as you can in the time allotted to labor.</p>
             <p>Make best use of your time.</p>
             <p>Do the best you can otherwise you're a looser. You don't even have to win when you do the best you can. We call that ultimate winning, doing the best you can.</p>

             <h3 class="_heading3">4. Results</h3>
             <p>Results is the name of the game.</p>
            <p>The challenge of life is to make measurable progress in reasonable time.</p>
            <p>We have to understand what is reasonable time for one to progress, grow, change and develop.</p>
            <p>Expect measurable progress in reasonable time. (Like it should only take a year for a child to succeed in 4th grade.)</p>
            <p>Make the demands of result on yourself by putting the pressure on yourself in terms of health, wealth, culture (refinement of the mind), sophistications, lifestyle and uniqueness.</p>
            <p>Don't mistake movement for achievement.</p>
            <p>Don't mistake busyness for effectiveness. Be busy doing the right things.</p>
            <p>Check results to determines what part of your life needs some changes or fixes.</p>

            <h3 class="_heading3">Lifestyle</h3>
            <p>This is simply how you choose to live. The genius of living well.</p>
            <p>All of us can choose how we choose to live.</p>
            <p>You can either get joy or animosity from your money.</p>
            <p>Don't just study economics, study happiness.</p>
            <p>Happiness is an art, not an accident.</p>
            <p>Some have figured out things economically, but they haven't figured out lifestyle to live well.</p>
            <p>A sophisticated gentleman knows that a rose on time is more valuable than a $1,000 gift too late.</p>
            <p>It's not the amount that counts, it's the genius that counts. It's the ideas that count.</p>
            <p>Be happy with what you've got while you pursue what you want.</p>
            <p><b>Find ways to live uniquely.</b></p>
            <p>Ten years from now you will arrive. The question is, where? Now's the time to fix the next 10 years.</p>

            <p>Untill you get very specific about your goals, the creative part of your brain won't jump in to help you get there and that's why many people don't accomplish their dreams. Break it down into the specifics of, how much and by when. Make it specific.</p>
            <p>Break your goals down then figure out to accomplish those small goals. Anything can be done if you break it down enough.</p>
            <p>Confidence is a muscle, the more you focus on it and train it, the more it grows.</p>

            <h1 class="blog_title">The Psychology of Money</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="blog_body">
            <h2 class="_heading2">Introduction</h2>
            <p>Aim of the book is to use short stories to convince you that soft skills (which are what is called the psychology of money) are more important than the technical side of money so as to make better financial decisions.</p>
            <p class="note_better">A genius is the man who can do the average thing when everyone else around him is losing his mind - Napoleon</p>
            <p class="note_better">The world is full of things which nobody by any chance ever observes. - Sherlock Holmes</p>
            <h2 class="_heading2">The Greatest show on Earth.</h2>
            <p>The premise of the books is that doing well with money has little to do with how smart you are and a lot to do with how you behave.</p>
            <p>Behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people.</p>
            <p>A genius who loses control of their emotions can be a financial disaster. Ordinary folks with no financial education can be wealthy if they have a handful of behavioral skills that have nothing to do with a formal measure of intelligence.</p>
            <p>In investing, even people with no college education can beat immensely those from top universities, with great training and the with the best connections.</p>
            <p>There's two explanations for financial success:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Financial outcomes are driven by luck, independent of intelligence and effort. This is true to some extent.</li>
                <li>(more common) - Financial success is not a hard science. It's a soft skill (the soft skill is called the psychology of money), where how you behave is more important than what you know. Soft skills are more important than the technical side of money because soft skills though underappreciated, greately help make better financial decisions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There two topics that impact everyone, whether you're interested or not: Health and money.</p>
            <p>Through collective trial and error over the years, we've learned how to become better farmers, skilled plumbers and advanced chemists. But has trial and error taught us to become better with our personal finances? Are we less likely to burry ourselves in debt? More likely to save for a rainy day? Have a realistic view about what money does and doesn't do to our happiness? There's no compelling evidence.</p>
            <p>Most of the reason is that we think about and are taught about money in a way that's too much like physics (with rules and laws) and not enough like psychology (with emotions and nuance).</p>
            <p>Money is everywhere, it affects all of us and confuses most of us. Everyone thinks about it a little differently.</p>
            <p>Money is one of the greatest shows on earth that offer a more magnifying glass that helps explain why people behave the way they do in areas like risk, confidence and happiness.</p>
            <p>Physics isn't controversial. It's guided by laws. Finance is different. It's guided by people's behaviors. And how I behave might make to sense to me but look crazy to you.</p>
            <p>Financial crisis can be better understood through the lense of psychology and history, not finance.</p>

            <h2 class="_heading2">1. No one's crazy</h2>
            <p>Your personal experiences with money make up maybe 0.00000001% of what's happened in the world, but maybe 80% of how you think the world works.</p>
            <p>Knowing what to do tells you nothing about happens in your head when you try to do it.</p>
            <p>Most common way to get a dignified retirement since 1980s has been to save and invest.</p>
            <p>401(K) is the backbone savings vehicle of American retirement.</p>
            <p>Most of us are bad at saving and investing for retirement not because we're crazy but because we're all just newbies.</p>
            <p>No one's crazy and we all make decisions base on our own unique experiences that seem to make sense to us in a given moment.</p>

            <h2 class="_heading2">2. Luck and Risk</h2>
            <p>Luck and risk are siblings. Both are the reality that every outcome in life is guided by forces other that individual effort.</p>
            <p>So the reality of life is: Luck, Risk and Individual effort.</p>
            <p>Bill Dougall - believed book study wasn't enough without real-world experience. He also realized the need to know computers when one got to college.</p>
            <p>Bill Gates and Paul Allen toyed with the computer at their School at leisure, letting creativity run wild; after school, late into the night and on weekends. They quickly became computing experts.</p>
            <p>They also read fortune magazines about fortune 500 companies and this made them realize they could be CEOs or ambassadors and thus have an impact in the world.</p>
            <p>While Bill Gates and Paul Allen experienced luck, Kent Evans experienced luck's close sibling, risk. He would have been a founding partner of MIcrosoft which Bill Gates and Paul Allen but died in a mountaneering accident before graduating high school.</p>
            <p>Luck and risk are so similar that you can't believe in one without equally respecting the other.</p>
            <p>The world is too complex to allow 100% of your actions to dictate 100% of goal outcomes.</p>
            <p>Luck definitely plays a role in financial success and investing too.</p>
            <p>When judging others, attributing success to luck makes you look jealous and means even if we know it exists.</p>
            <p>We're all tryng to learn what works and what doesn't with money. investing strategies that work and those that don't, business strategies that work and those that don't, how to get rich and how to avoid being poor.</p>
            <p>We tend to seek out these lessons by observing successes and failures and saying "Do what he did, avoid what he did."</p>
            <p>We have brains that prefer easy answers without much appetite for nuance.</p>
            <p>Countless fortunes (and failures) owe their outcome to leverage.</p>
            <p>Best (and worst) managers drive their employees as hard as they can.</p>
            <p>Customer is always right and customers don't know what they want are both accepted business wisdom.</p>
            <p>The line between inspiringly bold and foolishly reckless can be a millimeter thick and only visible with hindsight.</p>
            <p>Difficulty in identifying what is luck, what is skill and what is risk is one of the biggest problems we face in trying to learn about the best way to manage money.</p>
            <p class="note_better">Be careful who you praise and admire. Be careful who you look down upon and wish to avoid becoming.</p>
            <p class="note_better">Some are born into families that encourage education, others against it. Some are born into flourishing economies encouraging of entreprenuership. Others are born into war and destruction. Be successful and earn it. But realize not all success is due to hard work and not all poverty is due to laziness. Keep this in mind when judging people including yourself.</p>
            <p>Focus less on specific individuals and case studies and more on broad patterns since the more broad the patterns of success and failure, the more applicable it might be to your life.</p>
            <p>The more extreme the outcome, the less likely you can apply its lessons to your own life, because the more likely the outcome was influenced by extreme ends of luck and risk.</p>
            <p>People who have control over their time tend to be happier in life.</p>
            <p class="note_better">Success is a lousy teacher, it seduces the smart into thinking they can't lose. - Bill Gates</p>
            <p>Failure can also be a lousy teacher because it seduces smart people into thinking their decisions were terrible when sometimes they just reflect the unforgiving realities or risk.</p>
            <p>As much as we recognize the role of luck in success, the role of risk means we should forgive ourselves and leave room for understanding when judging failures.</p>
            <p>The trick when dealing with failure is arranging your financial life in a way that a bad investment here and a missed financial goal there won't wipe you out so you can keep playing until the odds fall in your favor.</p>
            
            <h2 class="_heading2">3. Never Enough</h2>
            <p>When rich people do crazy things.</p>
            <p>Take an example of a basket ball player making $36 million a month then in the same team, another player making $456 a month and then again another person say, Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos earning $1 Million a day.</p>
            <p>Failing to have a sense of enough has its own risks. One is that it leads to greed for more then in the long run you could end up losing yourself all you have.</p>
            <p>Like "to make money you don't have and don't need, you risk what you have and what do need. And that's foolish."</p>
            <p>When you have sufficent money to cover every reasonable thing you need and a lot of what you want, remember:</p>
            <p>i. The hardest finacial skill is to get the goalpost to stop moving.</p>
            <p>It gets dangerous when the taste of having more money, more power, more prestige increases ambition faster than satisfaction.</p>
            <p>In that case, one step forward pushes the goalpost two steps ahead.</p>
            <p>You feel as if you're falling behind and the only way to catch up is to take greateer and greater amounts of risk.</p>
            <p>Modern capitalism is a pro at two things: generating wealth and generating envy.</p>
            <p>Wanting to surpass your peers can be the fuel of hard work. But life isn't any fun without a sense of enough.</p>
            <p>Happiness is just results minus expectations.</p>
            <p>ii. Social comparison is the problem.</p>
            <p>The ceiling of social comparison is so high that virtually no one will ever hit it.</p>
            <p>This means it's a battle that can never be won, or that the only way to win is to not fight to begin with - accept that you might have enough, even if it's less than those around you.</p>
            <p>The only way to win in a Las Vegas casino is to exit as soon as you enter. That's exactly how the game of trying to keep up with other people's wealth works too.</p>
            <p>iii. Enough is too little.</p>
            <p>The idea of having "enough" might look like conservation, leaving opportunity and potential on the table but that's not right.</p>
            <p>Enough is realizing the opposite -  an insatiable appetite for more will push you to the point of regret.</p>
            <p>In business and investing, many stop reaching for more when they break and or when forced to.</p>
            <p>iv. There are many thing never worth risking, no matter the potential gain.</p>
            <p>Don't get too attached to anything - your reputation, accomplishments or any of it.</p>
            <p>Reputation is invaluable. Freedom and independence are invaluable. Family and friends are invaluable. Being loved by those who you want to love is invaluable. Happiness is invaluable.</p>
            <p>Best shot at keeping this things is knowing when it's time to stop taking risks that might harm them. Knowing when you have enough.</p>
            <p>The most powerful tool for building enough is remarkably simple, and doesn't require taking risks that could damage any of these things. The tool is Confounding and Compounding.</p>

            <h2 class="_heading2">4. Confounding Compounding</h2>
            <p>Our minds are not built to handle such absurdities.</p>
            <p>You don't need tremendous force to create tremendous results.</p>
            <p>If something compounds - if a little growth serves as the fuel for future growth -  a small starting base can lead to results so extraordinary they seem to defy logic.</p>
            <p>It can also be so logic-defying that you underestimate what's possible, where growth comes from and what it can lead to. And so it is with money.</p>
            <p>More than 2,000 books are dedicated to how Warren Buffet built his fortune but his fortune isn't due to just being a good investor, but also being a good investor since he was literally a child.</p>
            <p>Buffet began serious investing when he was 10 years old. By age 30, he had a net worth of $1 Million or $9.3 Million adjusted for inflation.</p>
            <p>Buffet's finanical success can be tied to the financial base he built in his pubescent years and the longetivity he maintained in his geriatric years.</p>
            <p>HIs skill is investing but his secret is time. That's how compounding works.</p>
            <p>Consider the story of Jim Simons, head of the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, who has compounded money at 66% annually since 1988 yet Buffet has compounded 22% annually - a third as much but Buffet is 75% richer than Jim Simons since he had less than half as many years to compound compared to Buffet.</p>
            <p>The point is that what seems like small changes in growth assumptions can lead to ridiculous, impractical numbers.</p>
            <p>Linear thinking is so much more intuitive than exponential thinking.</p>
            <p>Take an example of a math sum: 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8. Your brain can easily calculate the answer as 72. But if asked to calculate: 8 x 8 x 8 x 8 x 8 x 8 x 8 x 8 x 8. Your head would even explode to get the answer as 134, 217, 728.</p>
            <p>The counterintuitive nature of compounding leads even the smartest of us to overlook it's power.</p>
            <p>You never get accustomed to how quickly things can grow.</p>
            <p>The danger here is that when compounding isn't intuitive we often ignore it potential and focus on solving problems through other means. Not because we're overthinking but because we rarely consider compounding potential.</p>
            <p>The most powerful and important book should be called "Shut up and wait" with just one page with a long-term chart of economic growth.</p>
            <p>The practical takeaway is that the counterintuitiveness of compounding may be responsible for the majority of disappointing trades, bad strategies, and successful investing attempts.</p>
            <p>You can't blame people for devoting all their effort - effort in what they learn and what they do - to trying to earn the highest investment returns. It intuitive seems like the best way to get rich but good investment isn't about earning the highest returns, because the highest returns tend to be one-off hits that can't be repeated.</p>
            <p>It's about earning pretty good returns that you can stick with and which can be repeated for the longest period of time. Tha's when compounding runs wild.</p>
            <p>Opposite of this - earning huge return that can't be held onto - leads to some tragic stories.</p>

            <h2 class="_heading2">5. Getting wealthy vs Staying wealthy</h2>
            <p>Good investing is not necessarily about making good decisions. It's about consistently not screwing up.</p>
            <p>There's a million ways to get wealthy and plenty of books on how to do so, but there's only one way to stay wealthy: Some combination of frugality and paranoia.</p>
            <p>Getting money is one thing. Keeping it is another. Getting money and keeping it are two different skills.</p>
            <p>If to summarize money success in a single word, it would be "survival"</p>
            <p>Getting money requires taking risks, being optimistic, and putting yourself out there. But keeping money requires the opposite of taking risk. It requires humility, and fear that what you've made can be taken away from you just as fast.</p>
            <p>It require frugality and an acceptance that at least some of what you've made is attributable to luck, so past success can't be railed upon to repeat indefinitely.</p>
            <p>Tomorrow cannot be like yesterday and you can't rest on your laurels. You can't be complacent. You can't assume yesterday's success translates into tomorrow's good fortune.</p>
            <p>Not "growth" or "brains" or "insight". The ability to stick around for a long time, without wiping out or being forced to give up, is what makes the biggest difference.</p>
            <p>This should be the cornerstone of your strategy, whether it's in investing or your career or a business you own.</p>
            <p>There's two reasons why a survival mentality is so key with money.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>One is, few gains are so great that they're woth wiping yourself out over.</li>
                <li>The other is the counterintuitive math of compounding.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Compounding only works if you can give an asset years and years to grow. It's like planting oak trees. A year of growth will never show much progress, 10 years can make a meaningful difference and 50 years can create something absolutely extraordinary.</p>
            <p>But getting and keep that extraordinary growth requires surviving all the unpredictable ups and downs that everyone inevitably experiences over time.</p>
            <p>Applying the survival mindset to the real world comes down to appreciating three things:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>More than I want big returns, I want to be financially unbreakable. And if I'm unbreakable I actually think I'll get the biggest returns, because I'll be able to stick around long enough for compounding to work wonders. Preventing one desperate, ill-timed stock sale can do more for your lifetime returns than picking dozens of big-time winners. Compounding doesn't rely on earning big returns. Merely good returns sustained, uninterrupted for the longest perios of time - especially in times of chaos or havoc - will always win.</li>
                <li>Planning is important, but the most important part of every plan is to plan on the plan not going according to plan. Financial and investment planning are critical, because they let you know whether your current actions are withing the realm of reasonable. But few plans of any kind survive their first encounter with the real world. A plan is only useful if it can survive reality. And a future filled with unknowns is everyone's reality. A good plans embraces and emphasizes room for error. e.g For your savings, you can say, "it'd be great if the market returns 8% a year over the next 30 years, but if it only does 4% a year, it'll still be Ok" the more valuable your plan becomes. Room for error - often called margin of safety - is one of the most underappreciated forces of finance. It comes in many forms: A frugal budget, flexible thinking, and a loose timeline - anything that let's you live happily with a range of outcomes. It's different from being conservative. Conservative is avoiding a certain level of risk. Margin safety is raising the odds of success at a given level or risk by increasing your chances of survival. It's magic is that the higher your margin of safety, the smaller your edge needs to be to have a favorable outcome.</li>
                <li>A barbelled personality - optimistic about the future, but paranoid about what will prevent you from getting to the future - is vital. Optimism is usually defined as a belief that things will go well. But that's incomplete. Sensible optimism is a belief that the odds are in your favor, and over time things will balance out to a good outcome even if what happens in between is filled with misery. And in fact, you know it will be filled with misery. You can be optimistic that the long-term growth trajectory is up and to the right, but equally sure that the road between now and then is filed with landmines, and always will be. Those two things are not mutually exclusive.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The idea that something can gain over the long run while being a basketcase in the short run is not intuitive, but it's how a lot of things work in life.</p>
            <p>Destruction in the face of progress is not only possible but an efficient way to get rid of excess.</p>
            <p>A mind that can be paranoid and optimistic at the same time is hard to maintain, because seeing things as black or white takes less effort than accepting nuance. But you need short-term paranoia to keep you alive long enough to exploit long-term optimism.</p>

            <h2>Chapter seven</h2>
            <p>Work to learn, not for money.</p>
            <p>Seek work for what you will learn, more than what you will earn.</p>
            <p>Look for the skills you want to acquire before choosing a specific profession and before getting trapped in the "Rat Race".</p>
            <p>The world is filled with smart, talented, educated and gifted people. We mee them every day. The are around us.</p>
            <p>The sad truth is great talent is not enough. It's shocking how little talented people earn.</p>
            <p>Most people especially the educated ones, are usually one more skill away from great wealth. This means they need only to learn and master one more skill and their income would jump exponentially.</p>
            <p>Financial intelligence is a synergy of accounting, investing, marketing and law. Combine the four technical skills and making money with money is easier.</p>
            <p>When it comes to money, the only skill people know is to work hard.</p>
            <p>Schools reward people who study more and more about less and less. This means you should want to know a litlle about a lot.</p>
            <p>The hardest part of managing a company is managing people. If you're not a good leader, you'll get shot in the back, just like they do in business.</p>
            <p>Sales teaches you to overcome the fear of knocking on doors and getting rejected.</p>
            <p>It's best to go broke before 30. You still have time to recover.</p>
            <p>Keep seeking the emerging nations.</p>
            <p>There's an old cliche that goes, "Job is an acronum for Just Over Broke."</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the saying applies to millions of people.</p>
            <p>School does not teach financial intellingece so most workers "live withing their means." They work and pay the bills.</p>
            <p>Another horrible management theory goes, "workers work hard enough to not be fired, and owners pay just enough so that workers won't quit.'"</p>
            <p>The net result is most workers never get ahead. They do what they've been taught to do. "Get a secure job"</p>
            <p>Most workers focus on working for pay and benefits that reward them in the short term, but it often disastrous in the long run.</p>
            <p>Once people get trapped in the lifelong process of bill paying, they become like those little hamsters running around in those little metal wheels. Their little furry legs are spinning furiously, the wheel is turning furiously, but come tomorrow morning, they'll still be in the same cage: great job.</p>
            <p>Ask yourself the question, where is this daily activity taking you? Where is your hard work taking you and what does the future hold? </p>

        </div>
        <div class="blog_body">
            <p>from Bishop David Oyedepo (YouTube)</p>
            <p>planning is winning just as breathing is living</p>
            <p>planning is very vital in any man's life and any business endeavor</p>
            <p>it is planning that gives value to purpose and empowers purpose to deliver. Purpose is dead and impotent without a plan.</p>
            <p>a planless farmer is a failure. You must have a plan to water in case if fails to rain. Failing to plan lead to doing things anyhow which leads to Frustration.</p>
            <p>every building begins with a plan. You don't need a plan for a Shanty, but you do need a plan for any building of any value.</p>
            <p>business is a form of building and just every building, it requires a plan which we call a business plan.</p>
            <p>YOU DON'T GROW BIG TO MANAGE WELL, YOU MANAGE WELL TO GROW BIG.</p>
            <p>the business that will be big tomorrow will be seen today... The quality of the structural plan that will be engaged.</p>
            <p>most businesses today are a victim of lack of a plan or poor planning. There's not differentiating between the capital and profit, everything is jumbled together.</p>
            <p>You don't need an accountant to be accountable, you must be accountable.</p>
            <p>You need strategic planning to maximize your business endeavors.</p>
            <p>If you're not futuristic in your approach, you can't earn a future.</p>
            <p>It is good management therefore that guarantees good results.</p>
            <p>The quality of management is what determines the quality of results. Therefore, management skill is key to determining the level of results that any organization will ever command.</p>
            <p>Life not well managed will be wasted. Time not well managed will be trashed. Money not well managed will be squandered.</p>
            <p>EVERYTHING THAT IS TO GROW MUST BE WELL MANAGED.</p>
            <p>Praying without planning is playing without knowing.</p>
            <p>Planning without programming is living in the woods. Programming without pursuit is dinning with the dead.</p>
            <p>Exploit is expensive.</p>
            <p>From purpose you move into planning, from planning, you section your plans into time slots, then set go...The pursuit begins.</p>
            <p>Prayer alone can make you a burden to God. It prayer with planning that makes you a co-labourer with God.</p>
            <p>It's your intellectual capacity that determines the quality of your plan. So you need facts.</p>
            <p>Without counsel, purposes are disappointed.</p>
            <p>Only those who sit down to plan today will shine tomorrow.</p>
            <p>Planning is the secret behind fulfilment of dreams.</p>
            <p>shallow men think of luck. But great men think of cause and effect.</p>
            <p>It takes sound planning to make a success of your business endeavor.</p>
            <p>No ones reigns without the use of the brain. It is the use of the brain that establishes the reign of man.</p>
            <p>LIFE IS PRACTICAL. NOT MYSTICAL. Therefore, give a practical approach in order to make the most of your adventure on earth.</p>
            <p>If you're not committed to mental work, you will end up doing menial work. It is brain work that makes things work. Everything that is doing great begins with brain work. That's what is takes to maximize your place in destiny.</p>

        <div class="blog_body">
            <p>from David Oyedepo (YouTube) 15-04-22</p>
            <p>Every time in God's presence offers a two fold opportunity; for information and for impactation and your readiness for the two is what makes the difference.</p>
            <p>Everything you in your hand today began in your mind yesterday.</p>
            <p>Whatever is too big for your mind too big for your hand.</p>
            <p>Whatever you cannot imagine, you can never deliver.</p>
            <p>Gen 11:6 - nothing can be refrained from them which they had imagined to do.</p>
            <p>It's your imagination that sets the pace for your destination.</p>
            <p>It's your mental picture that defines your actual future.</p>
            <p>Number 13:30 - The 12 spies sent to check out the land. 10 come with an evil report, Joshua and Caleb stilled the people and said, let us go up at once and posses it; for we are well able to overcome it.</p>
            <p>So it was a conflict of mentalities.</p>
            <p>The problem was not their problem, it was their mentality.</p>
            <p>When your mentality is in place, and in line with scriptures, you will enjoy diving covering.</p>
            <p>It is mentality that defines destiny.</p>

            <p>from David Oyedepo (Youtube) 15-04-22</p>
            <p>What you know determines how you think and how you think determines how you live and how you live determines what you become.</p>
            <p>What quality information does is it renews your mind by influencing your thinking and as a result, transforms your life.</p>
            <p>Until your mind is renewed or your mentality is re-energized, you cannot experience a change in position.</p>
            <p>How you are thinking determines where you are now, start thinking better and you get a better place.</p>
            <p>To improve a man's life, you first affect his thinking pattern, otherwise you cannot affect his lifestyle.</p>
            <p>When you see what has been done by others it influences your thinking pattern in getting done whatever you may have been asked to do.</p>
            <p>It is what you know that has power to influence how you think, which eventually transforms your lifestyle.</p>
            <p>Scripture is full of pictures. When you see the pictures it helps in defining your future.</p>
            <p>When all saw a giant in Goliath, David saw an opportunity. David could never have become king without kiling Goliath and the Israelites could have never entered the promised land without defeating the giants.</p>
            <p>There's obstacles on your way to fulfilling destiny that must be crushed before destiny is fulfilled.</p>
            <p>It is exposure that enlarges the scope of our mentality. The more you see through readings, personal contanct with accomplished individuals, the larger your coast of thinking becomes.</p>
            <p>Exposure does this, it enlarges your possibilty coast.</p>
            <p>Exploit is essentially a product of exposure and no ones future is guaranteed without exposure.</p>
            <p>To be exposed is to excel and to be inexposed is to be deposed.</p>
            <p>Exposure stretches your possiblity thinking which is a requirement for your accomplishment in life.</p>
            <p>There's many people loaded with potentials for building conglomerates but they cringe by the idea; if I dare that and something happens, where will I go?</p>
            <p>Gen 49:1-2 - the tribe of Reuben was destroyed by that cringing until they became stagnant.</p>
            <p>Invest in building your mentality through explorative researches particularly looking at the lives of men and what they had accomplished in your area of interest.</p>

            <p>from Dan Lok (You Tube)</p>
            <p>It's not how much money you make, it's how much money you keep. It's not how much money you keep, it's how well you invest that money.</p>
            <p>Habit is more important than the amount. Just put the habit into practice.</p>
            <p>It's the habit that makes the difference.</p>
            <p>Cash attracts more cash.</p>
            <p>Money has many jobs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>poor believe - spend</li>
                <li>smarter people believe - spend + save</li>
                <li>smarter people believe - spend + save + invest</li>
                <li>wise believe - spend + save + invest + donate</li>
            </ul>
            <p>make your money management system very simple otherwise you won't even use it.</p>
            <p class="heading">Bucket Management System</p>
            <p>the system should be put into place automatically otherwise it won't be done.</p>
            <p>the management system has 6 buckets:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Tithe (10%)</li>
                <li>Necessity Bucket (50%) - pay your bills</li>
                <li>Emergency Bucket (10%) - money put aside for a rainy day (Medical expenses or helping family members). This should not be used and should be more of like a locked savings account so you won't use it.</li>
                <li>Investment Bucket (10%) - Investments should return 7- 10%. Can be for future or retirement. Like pay yourself bucket.</li>
                <li>Learning Bucket (10%) - For seminars, tutorials, online courses, books and getting some coaching.</li>
                <li>Fun Bucket (5%) - For buying anything you want (Fancy watches, clothes, shoes)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>If 10% is impossible, than do 1% or 2% at least.</p>
            <p>The more you make, the more the investment bucket needs to grow, like 15 - 35% than necessity bucket should grow smaller to like 35%.</p>
            <p>With enough growth you can spend 1% on necessities and 99% on investments.</p>
            <p>Upgrade your skills to earn more.</p>
            <p>For credit cards, have 2 (one for business and the other for personal use)</p>

            <p>by Danlok (YouTube) 15-04-22</p>
            <p>Value time more than money. The rich value time more than money, the poor value money more than time.</p>
            <p>Consider an example of three people: The first one makes $1 Million in 40 years by earning $25,000 annually, the second one makes $1 Million annually and the third makes $1 Million a month.</p>
            <p>The $1 Million is the same but the time it takes to make it is what makes one rich and the other one poor. So the problem is not making the $1 Million, it's how much money it takes you to make that money.</p>
            <p>So this is why you should focus your time on the important things that can teach you how to earn or earn you the money.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Get on a written plan - or as know in the finacial word, a budget. Don't build a tower without first counting the cost. A budget is people telling money what to do instead of wondering where it went.</li>
                <li>Get out of debt. The borrower is always slave to the lender. A man with experience is not at the mercy of a man with an opinion. We mostly earn and lose money because we give it away to financial systems that are designed to take it from us. Quit borrowing money for anything or for any reason.</li>
                <li>Buy assets that generate some income. Some of the things we have own us. We don't own them.</li>
                <li>Foster high quality relationships. You become who you sorround yourself with. Your income in a decade will be within the average of your 10 closest friends. Choose friends you let xlose wisely.</li>
                <li>Save and Invest. In the house of the wise are stores of choice food and oil. A foolish man devours all he has. Spend all you make and Bibilically you're a fool. Having money for emergencies enables you to be more in a position to be incredibly, outrageously generous. It's hard to be generous when you're broke. If you're struggling, it's hard for you to notice others that are struggling. Learn to be generous and give away money and also enjoy money with family and friends.</li>

        <p>As humans, we can't help but compare ourselves with others. But this is one of the most destructive things we can do because we will always come up short.</p>
        <p>All comparison does is exaggarate our insecurities.</p>
        <p>Your friends are not there for you to compare yourself to. Instead, you can admire and also learn from them.</p>
        <p>Grow your own strenghts instead of always getting intimidated by the strength of others.</p>

            <p>Know what time you're most productive & get working then - are you a night owl or a morning person? do you relate more to a vampire than a rooster?</p>
            <p>make a schedule and stick to it - use a daily planner, your phone or a piece of paper. Hold yourself accountable</p>
            <p>put away any distractions - ensure your productive time is productive. Getting rid of distractions helps you get work done faster.</p>
            <p>try something new and go out of your comfort zone - let your curiosity lead you to new hobbies, opportunities, activities or places. Try a new hobby or skill. Challenge yourself everyday to something new, big or small. Make it a habit to not be afraid to make a new habit your habit </p>
            <p>Value being productive over being just busy - you can live your whole life just being busy and find there's little you've done over the years. Find what method works for you. Things get easier when you know who you are and what's best for you.</p>

            <p>We are creative beings working with an infinite amount of power. Once we understand the power of our mind, then we start to understand how to utilize it properly, then we understand that we can do virtually anything. We just have to learn how.</p>
            <p>Learning to earn money is the same as learning how to type or drive a car. It's just something you learn then you go ahead and do it.</p>
            <p>First sit down and decide what you want to do. If it's to make money, how much money?</p>
            <p>Be specific and write down on a card what exactly you want. Carry that card around and read it often then start to think of how you can get it.</p>
            <p>Thinking of why you can't do something is never going to do any good. Keep thinking until you think of how you can do it.</p>
            <p>When riches start to come, they come so quickly and in such great abundance that one wonders where they have been hiding through all those lean years.</p>
            <p>when you start to think and grow rich, you observe that riches begin with a state of mind. You need to know how to acquire that state of mind that attracts riches.</p>
            <p>If you can build an image of something in your mind, you can build a physical replica of it in the real world.</p>
            <p>We make the mistake of thinking that if we want to be a millionaire, then we gotta make a lot of money. That's not true. To be a millionaire, you must have a plan to be a millionaire and that's all you need.</p>
            <p>To earn more money doesn't mean to have multiple jobs or work for long hours. Study wealthy people and you'll realize they have many sources of income. Some even have 102.</p>

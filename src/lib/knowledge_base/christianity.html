					<p>Cutting down on your sexual sin for the next 7 years can help you recover mentally, bodily, emotionally and psychologically. Everytime you commit fornication something dies in you. You're attached to a spirit and to a soul. Sexual sin is against your own body. (Pastor John Anosike)</p>
					<p>The greatest sin as a Christian is not fornication or adultery, it's losing your fire and your zeal for God. Lose the fire and you will be falling into diverse sins. Your connection with God is priceless.</p>
					<p>The kingdom of God is not for gain. It's for loses. If you're not willing to lose it all, you're not fit for the kingdom. Jesus says, "if you cannot hate your father, husband, brother, sister for my sake, you're not fit for the kingdom." "Lose your life and you find it, keep it and you loose it."</p>
					<p>Be afraid of losing the annointing of the Holy Spirit. There's a price to pay for great works in the ministry.The secret of power is the Holy Spirit.</p>
					<p>When you praise God the right way, revelations come to you. Many dance carnally and that's why they have no spiritual growth. They dance and worship but then again go back to the same carnal habits. The Holy Spirit minister to you specifically.</p>
					<p>Nothing of value comes cheap. Like for God's presence, the price is deep hunger for His presence.</p>
					<p>If men applause you and God has not approved you, you have endangered your future.</p>
					<p>Religion is mainly about: money, power and control.</p>
					<p>It's not just that God ain't true (It's the head and the heart issue). It's that some don't want it to be true. But remember the story of a king who had to become a peasant after falling in love with peasant so he gave up the throne to be with her.</p>
					<p>One of the tests of greatness is your ability to survive frustration. God puts greatness in isolation which creates frustration because you have to be able to survive frustration in order to be eligible to become a leader.</p>
					<p>The most common command is to not be afraid becuase it's more of faith in the enemy instead of faith in Christ.</p>
					<p>Living a sexually pure life is essential to living a christian life.</p>
					<p>It important as a christian to ask yourself what you've been save from? Like why walk to the cross yet you don't get on it.</p>
					<p>Grace is not just a cover up for sin. It's God given for us to be made perfect in Christ. Repent and change not live in your fallen nature. Grace transforms us into new creature.</p>
					<p>Without prayer, your theology is just marbles of a little body. You need to also have Godliness, Holiness, Separateness.</p>
					<p>Find the things God hates and avoid them like a plague. Find the things God loves and embrace them. This can be done by immersing yourself in the word of God.</p>
					<p>Satan derails you from your destiny by connecting you with people that are not serious with theirs. Make friends with your future.</p>
					<p>Assume you have commited a crime. Justice would be you paying fairly for your mistake like life imprisonment, Mercy would be you serving less time than you should, Grace would be someone showing up with keys and letting you go free without having to pay anything.</p>
					<p>There's three major trees in the Bible. At the tree of knowledge of good and evil, we failed. Jesus paid for it at the tree of Calvary. Once we accept what He did for us on the cross we now have access to the tree of life.</p>
					<p>The devil targets your mind with the weapon of his lies.</p>
					<p>A house divided cannot stand. Refuse for your family to be divided.</p>
					<p>Even after giving your life to Jesus, you will always mess up. Fall down and get up over and over all the way to heaven.</p>

					<h1 class="blog_title">Deception in Knowledge</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="blog_body">
					<p>by Prophet Lovy (YouTube). 11_12_2022.</p>
					<p>Nobody has it correct which is why God gave us His righteousness (Jesus) and this is also why we should also correct each other with humility.</p>
					<p>Wisdom and Understanding are what give us the full knowledge of God. None of these are good independently.</p>
					<p>We must walk with God so that we can get to the level of knowing the secrets of God.</p>
					<p>You can corrupt yourself but not the annointing or the Holy Spirit or the things of the Holy Spirit.</p>
					<p>It becomes a problem when we have knowledge without revelation.</p>
					<p>The casting out of demons is the beginning of deliverance, knowing the truth is the completion of the deliverance.</p>
					<p>Knowledge comes if you have wisdom, understanding and revelation.</p>
					<p>God the father became man and sacrificed himself to buy us because with His blood to the Father to transfer ownership to the son so we can relate with Him. We can't relate with God the father because He is too pure. The son is the only one qualified to stand before the Father.</p>
					<p>This is why Jesus said, nobody comes to the father except through me and the father can't get to anyone except through Christ.</p>
					<p>Understand Jesus as Lord because He is the master that bought you.</p>
					<p>Jesus saved us from the wrath and anger of God the father.</p>
					<p>It is God the father that punishes sin. Hence those who are saved are not in the wrath of God.</p>
					<p>The Spirit of the Lord brings the acknowledgement of Jesus as the Lord and savior by convicting men of their sin.</p>
					<p>Once you recieve the Spirit of God through salvation, the nature of Christ has begun in you but it is not complete yet, then wisdom and Understanding (revelation or opening of the eyes) comes to you.</p>
					<p>Mental knowledge is not spiritual knowledge. Spiritually, wisdom and understanding (revelation) are more important because then it becomes easier to digest knowledge.</p>

					<h1 class="blog_title">A report from beyond</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="blog_body">
					<p>by Prophet Lovy (YouTube). 09_12_2022.</p>
					<p>Not every situation needs you to act on it. Some are the devil trying to take your resources from you. Let the Holy Spirit move you to do it. Unless God moves you don't do it because you can deliver or save everyone.</p>
					<p>Everything about you must be moved.</p>
					<p>There's a gift of help. Some people can help you and you just move to a higher level. Others are called to just serve.</p>
					<p>You were not designed to remain the way you are. You're called to conform to the image of Jesus. Your human spirit should evolve into a heavenly host. Like Moses and Elijah.</p>
					<p>Read scriptures (Matt 22: 30) to understand the whole council of God. This helps even in making decision when the word of God is not really clear on what to do.</p>
					<p>If you don't take the whole council of God you will not enjoy all you're supposed to enjoy.</p>
					<p>All spirits are not angels. Like watcher had sperms but Lucifer has never made any woman pregnant so these are different beings.</p>
					<p>The word angel means Malach.</p>
					<p>Heb 1:7 - Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers flames of fire - means even angels ascend into spirits too. Spirit is usually according to you function.</p>
					<p>An elder in revelations means one seasoned in truths no other has seen or known.</p>
					<p>You spiritual elevation is measured by the word that enters you, not how many scriptures you know or have memorized. Scripture is for your soul, the word is for your spirit. The more the word, the more the light you accumulate. Your content is measure by the content of light within you.</p>
					<p>Angels are attracted to light, so if full of light, angels are attracted to you.</p>
					<p>Your ranking in the spirit is what allows you to do certain things because it is the one that works for you even when you stumble.</p>
					<p>Authority is delegated not just given. It operates in juridisctions. There's places authority works and there's others you don't have juridisction.</p>
					<p>God uses us because He is good, not because we are good.</p>

					<h1 class="blog_title">Maximizing Personal Retreats.</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="blog_body">
					<p>by Apostle Joshua Selman (YouTube) - 29-08-22</p>
					<p>This retreat should be between you and God only.</p>
					<p>There's certain things you will only hear from God if you're alone with Him.</p>
					<p>A retreat should be about 2 days where 1 is for thanksgiving.</p>

					<p>Activities during a retreat.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Thanksgiving - Take your time to thank God. Mention your blessings one by one. Thanksgiving should be with lots of observation and carefullness of the even the little things.</li>
						<li>Review your current year's progress - Break your review into
							<ul>
								<li>Spiritual life - </li>
								<li>Passion for God</li>
								<li>Illumination of the word you have accessed - what do you understand you didn't.</li>
								<li>Character - are you useful to society and to God's plans. Are you becoming a leader.</li>
								<li>Mental capacity and development - have you acquired useful information. Are you relevant to the society. Sustain the ability to be useful. What do you know about mindset, leadership, poverty.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>How much have you taken care of your body and health.</li>
						<li>Review your assignment and purpose in life then your kingdom service - Be occupied with purpose. Time must be well invested fullfilling purpose. Don't be busy yet not moving forward.</li>
						<li>Finances - both in personal and kingdom advance. Living to seek money all your life is not just bad, it's a curse. Nobody was designed to do that. There should be a time God provides the required financial resources to help you find time to serve Him and focus on more useful things. Finance is one of the areas your disobedience shows immediately. Wastage of resources is sin. Sow small reap small. Sow bountiful and reap bountiful - scriputures can't be broken. Look at the level of your giving to God's kingdom. Review your understanding of finances too.</li>
						<li>Relationships - marital, career, business, destiny. Avoid bad and useless associations. Walk with the wise and you'll be wise. Whose presence did you give access to your life that destroyed or improved the quality of your life. Review the access you've given the Holy Spirit too.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Excell in all areas. Review the most successful and worst areas then try to improve so you excel in all the 6 areas.</p>

					<h1 class="blog_title">Choices</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="blog_body">
					<p>from David Oyedepo (YouTube) - 25-02-2022</p>
					<p>God never tells us to do what He has not engraced us to do.</p>
					<p>Destiny is absolutely a product of one's choice.</p>
					<p>Det 30:19 - I lay before you life and death, blessings and curses, choose life that both thou and thy seed may live.</p>
					<p>Until a choice is made, every other principle or ideology becomes helpless.</p>
					<p>Every negative experience in life begins with a negative thought.</p>
					<p>If you don't stop that evil thought, it will stop you.</p>
					<p>You're never a failure untill you look for who to blame for it.</p>
					<p>One wrong choice can wreck a whole destiny.</p>
					<p>Take responsibility for the outcome of your life.</p>

					<p>
						Life without God's presence was not His original plan for us. He
						designed us to know Him, living in close, intimate fellowship with
						Him.
					</p>
					<p>
						Life for most people is so difficult and unfulfilling because we are
						living without the one thing that is essential for our fulfillment
						and well-being. We are living without the continous, enduring
						presence of God.
					</p>
					<p>
						God's presence is conditional. He doesn't come simply because we
						want Him to. He comes when the conditions are right.
					</p>

					<h2>God's original plan for makind</h2>
					<p>
						God's greates desire as revealed in the scriptures is for a family.
					</p>
					<p>
						God's original idea for creation was a desire to have a friend and a
						son to share in His authority and rule not serve Him as a servant.
					</p>
					<p>
						God was interested in a different kind of relationship that we
						normally think of when we talk about a king. He wanted sons who
						would not only be led by the king but who would also exercise the
						King's authority and rule on earth.
					</p>
					<p>
						God first gave man his image and likeness then placed him in His
						presence which means He wanted man to act like Him and live with
						Him.
					</p>
					<p>
						The word image means - resemblance or exact likeness. Therefore, to
						be made in God's image means that man resembles God and is an exact
						likeness of Him.
					</p>
					<p>
						God's priorities were for man to have His nature and to be in His
						presence.
					</p>
					<p>
						God did not establish reverent patterns, pious traditions or
						religious activities in the Garden of Eden. There was smply a
						relationship between God and man.
					</p>
					<p>
						Establishing and maintaining this relationship continues to be God's
						primary concern.
					</p>
					<p>
						He is muchmore concerned about our fellowship with Him than about
						our works, our activities, our traditions, and even our busyness.
						God wants relationship—that’s the bottom line—and everything God
						established for man was built on this desire for fellowship.
					</p>
					<p>
						Thus, God created man for a specific purpose: to have dominion over
						all the earth; with an image different from that of all other parts
						of His creation: His own spiritual and moral nature; and with the
						ability to function like He does: seeing things that are not yet
						visible (faith).
					</p>
					<p>
						Sadly, what God intended for man and man’s current experience are
						quite different. This difference is a result of man’s choice to
						disregard the principles that are an inherent part of God’s
						creation.
					</p>

					<h2>God is a God of principles</h2>
					<p>
						Man’s ability to fulfill his purpose and to be all God intended him
						to be is predicated on the requirement that he obey the principles
						God established when He created human beings.
					</p>
					<p>
						God is a God of principles. Everything He created was established to
						operate by certain principles that guarantee its proper function.
						This pattern in creation includes human beings. We were created to
						operate by principles that God established before He created us.

					<h1>Relationship Goals</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="blog_body">
					<h2>Before the person</h2>
					<p>
						In our society today with all the social media, we tend to base our
						ideas of how a relationship is supposed to be from the ideas we from
						all the social media, pop culture and our society more than what the
						word of God says, but the problem is, society changes the standards
						for relationships every now and then (like now, you don't need
						commitment to anybody for you to cross the line into private areas).
					</p>
					<p>
						So we need to base our ideas and standard of relationship on
						something that does not change which is the word of God. Isaiah 40:8
						- The grass withers and the flowers fade, but the word of our God
						stands forever.
					</p>
					<p>
						Let's test and see what can happen to our minds, hearts and lives if
						we follow the Biblical model of relationship instead of just our
						emotions or feelings.
					</p>
					<p>
						Problem is most of the time we're taught without balance about
						relationships and so we tend to go with what every other person is
						doing.
					</p>
					<p>
						It's funny how when people think about relationships, they don't
						look at Christians because even Christians have failed. Most, saved,
						sanctified, believing christians can clap and stamp their feet as
						they pray all day but end up dying lonely. Preach to the nations yet
						have no friends.
					</p>
					<p>
						So what exactly is the Biblical model of relationships, because we
						know we're not supposed to have sex before marriage, we're supposed
						to be in a monogamous marriage. But how are we supposed to that?
					</p>
					<p>
						Most people can be in a relationship without goals and that's one of
						the problems.
					</p>
					<p>
						A goal is the result or achievement toward which effort is directed;
						aim; end.
					</p>
					<p>So effort has to be directed to reach a goal.</p>
					<p>
						whether single, married, divorced, separated, a stalker or it's
						complicated. Whatever level, God wants you to have successful
						relationships.
					</p>
					<p>
						Most of us have no goals so we take whatever comes our way because
						of what culture has also taught us or at times blinded our vision
						with. But without aim or a goal we can't have success in
						relationships like God wants us to.
					</p>
					<p>
						What happens is that people get damaged and broken when we have no
						clear aim of what God wants us to have in a relationship.
					</p>
					<p>It's important to have proper goals set by God's standard.</p>
					<p>
						So to understand relationships, we have to look at the beginning.
						Because that's where we first see relationship.
					</p>
					<p>
						Before there was ever a person, there was relationship. Father, Son
						and the Holy Spirit.
					</p>
					<p>
						When God made everything, He saw it was good but in Gen 2:18 - Then
						the LORD God said, "It is not good for the man to be alone. I will
						make a helper who is just right for him."
					</p>
					<p>So here we find God saying it's not good.</p>
					<p>
						So the real question here is what did God see that was not good for
						man to be alone, unless He knows something about man that we don't.
					</p>
					<p>So what we have to realize is that:</p>
					<p>1. God wants relationship for your.</p>
					<p>
						Now, this is tricky esp for us introverts who wonder why we have to
						say hello to people in church, we just want to take online courses,
						work from home. But that's not God's intent for you because He
						created to be in relationship with others.
					</p>
					<p>
						So it's not good for us to set up a life that's guarded, gated and
						isolated all by yourself because that's where the enemy comes to be
						your friend and he comes with all these lies because lies are his
						native tongue and the funny thing is that we accept most of these
						lies, let them grow in our hearts to the point they stop us from
						reaching our purpose and destiny.
					</p>
					<p>
						The good thing about having people around you is that they can point
						our things in your character that are a little bit messed up or even
						help us out.
					</p>
					<p>
						So God wants you to have relationship, He wants you to have a best
						friend even though the last one betrayed you, he wants you to have a
						safe place, a pastor and a leader that can guide and help you even
						though the last one used you or didn't appreciate you, He wants you
						to be a marriage that works and is filled with love, respect, honor
						and fun because God is a redeemer.
					</p>
					<p>
						Ecc 4:9-12 Two people are better than one, for they can help each
						other succeed. So who are you linked up with, because when you find
						God, you'll be better.
					</p>
					<p>
						You can tell if a relationship is from God just from the
						qualification, does this relationship help you?
					</p>
					<p>
						Often at times we tolerate relationships that are taking away from
						us, steal our peace, ravage our hearts and have us up all night
						becuase we're insecure. And we think they are our friends and they
						are fly but they are fake.
					</p>
					<p>
						So God wants relationship with you first then He wants relationship
						for you with others.
					</p>
					<p>
						And it's just one my pet peeves how everybody acts like
						relationships are from the devil. But they are not.
					</p>
					<p>
						It's relationships where the purpose is not known, that open the
						door to the devil. If we know the purpose for our relationships,
						then we won't allow the cracks that let the enemy come into these
						relationships.
					</p>
					<p>God designed an order for our relationships to be successful.</p>
					<p>
						Gen 2:8 - Then the LORD God planted a garden in Eden in the east,
						and there He placed the man he had made. V15 - The LORD God placed
						the man in the Garden of Eden to tend and watch over it. v17 -
						except the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
					</p>
					<p>
						There's 5 things God wants to give us before the person, before
						anybody partners with us. But most of the times we look for people
						to take the place of what only God can give us.
					</p>
					<p>2. So what does God desire to give you before the person?</p>
					<p>
						i. a place - not necessarily your own apartment. But put you in a
						place where purpose can happen in your life.
					</p>
					<p>
						Most of us to place ourselves, like am about to move to here. And
						they are searching for a place and people to validate the place they
						are in.
					</p>
					<p>
						God gave Adam a place He didn't have anything to do with. What you
						think is a coincidence might be God's placement for you. So even
						though that family might be crazy, there's something God wanted to
						teach you through that family. There's some things God wanted to
						develop on the inside of you, and there's tolerance God wanted to
						build.
					</p>
					<p>
						Most of the times we find ourselves fighting the place so hard, the
						job he placed us in, the people God placed us around, the church He
						planted us in.
					</p>
					<p>
						So at times, there's things we need for our success that are in the
						place God has put us in but we fight the place so much that we don't
						even see what God has for us there.
					</p>
					<p>
						So God placed you in that school. You may not see why you're in that
						place but it's there. God's the one in charge of promotions, access
						granted or denied and He placed you in that school.
					</p>
					<p>
						ii. Purpose - the other thing God reveals when you're in that place
						is your purpose. Adam was placed in the garden to tend and work the
						land.
					</p>
					<p>
						We try hard to get the person but ignore the place and so they the
						purpose.
					</p>
					<p>
						We complain a lot about the place but if you start embracing the
						place God has you in, you'll start embracing the purpose why He put
						you there.
					</p>
					<p>
						At times we find ourselves in situations that seem like we are
						between a rock and a hard place and wonder "Why am I here?" But a
						good conclusion is that if you're there and it's uncomfortable, it's
						for your growth.
					</p>
					<p>Adam started working in purpose before He ever got a person.</p>
					<p>
						So while we're trying to get him or her, God's trying to reveal to
						you why He has you her.
					</p>
					<p>
						Until you stop fighting to have people in the places only God can
						fill, you'll always be disappointed with where God has you.
					</p>
					<p>
						iii. Provision - and this is a good indicator whether God's in your
						place or purpose.
					</p>
					<p>
						Gen 2:19 - God made the trees grow up. So if you have to go and
						position yourself to provide for what God has called to do, it's not
						Him.
					</p>
					<p>
						God supplies where He has called us to because He funds His ideas.
					</p>
					<p>
						God will listen to you pray about your plans, but only provide for
						His.
					</p>
					<p>God makes provision grow wherever He is.</p>
					<p>
						iv. Identity - God placed the man He had made then back in Gen 1 we
						find out how man was made - in the image to be like God.
					</p>
					<p>
						If your identity, who you are, your personality, character is being
						defined by anybody else but God, you have a missview of who you're
						supposed to be.
					</p>
					<p>
						The enemy is not afraid of a faker or counterfeit but about you
						finding purpose, knowing who you are, not caring what other people
						are doing but instead remaining flat footed obeying God.
					</p>
					<p>
						So why is our age trying to compare to what someone else is? Because
						if you can be thrown off, you identity gets stolen. Like you're
						reminded that your family is not enough, your genes are just not
						perfect, you don't have this or that.
					</p>
					<p>
						You can never be completely comfortable in the identity of somebody
						who's not you.
					</p>
					<p>
						The good thing is that, you don't have to guess what your identity
						is, God has already given it to you. Called to be of the royal
						priesthood, joint heirs with Christ, you have Christ living in you,
						the head not the tail, above not beneath, either you accept it or
						not, either you've accepted your identity or taken somebody else's.
					</p>
					<p>
						Stop accepting what somebody who didn't know their identity told
						you.
					</p>
					<p>
						Problem is, most of us have not been in the book enough to be able
						to find their identity, so people tell you your identity on
						instagram, in business meetings and all this other places and you
						take on that perception.
					</p>
					<p>
						What you think is not enough is what God wants to use but you have
						to remember you identity is confirmed and affirmed in Him.
					</p>
					<p>
						v. Parameters - God said, v16 - you may freely eat the fruit of
						every tree in the garden - but the LORD warned him, except the tree
						of the knowledge of good and evil, if you eat of its fruit, you are
						sure to die."
					</p>
					<p>
						Any good parent knows if you don't set limitations for you kids,
						they will not hurt themselves on purpose but because of what's
						around them.
					</p>
					<p>Most believers are spiritually immature so without parameters,</p>
					<p>
						Now it's not like there was just two trees, there's many but you
						can't eat from this one.
					</p>
					<p>
						Parameters came before the person so if you have no standard before
						getting into relationships, the relationships will create the
						standard that you live by.
					</p>
					<p>
						Most of us get hurt by the relationship because we did not take heed
						of the parameters God gave for purity, accountability, being honest
						and open.
					</p>
					<p>
						And the funny thing is that two are better than one at everything,
						even messing up.
					</p>
					<p>
						So if you have no standard, and get together with someone who also
						has no standard, guess what you're about to create? A hot mess.
					</p>
					<p>
						1 Cor 10:23 - am allowed to do anything but not everything is
						beneficial.
					</p>
					<p>
						The real power of being a mature christian, being secure because you
						know your identity as a Christian is when you know you can but you
						don't have to.
					</p>
					<p>
						Yes you can watch porn, start a random relationship on the internet,
						drink all you want but you don't need a rule anymore to tell you all
						of that because of the relationship you have with God.
					</p>
					<p>
						There's some things we only learn when they start off as parameters,
						then we obey.
					</p>
					<p>
						At times telling these parameters even to young believers can take
						us to a point where they are the ones reminding you of the
						parameters set.
					</p>
					<p>
						Think of all the relationships in your life and all the people you
						come in contact with. There's people that will tell us our genes are
						not that cool, we're a little bit odd, by 19 you should be dating,
						or by 24 you should already have a car and a house, or we think we
						should be this or that just because of what people have been telling
						us. What happens is we're a vessel and what's been filling us is
						what the world or other people has to say.
					</p>
					<p>
						But in 2 Peter 1:3 - by his divine power, God has given us
						everything we need for living a godly life. We have received all
						this by coming to know him, the one who called us to himself by
						means of his marvelous glory and excellence.
					</p>
					<p>
						So how do we get to get rid of that people have told us or what
						we're struggling with? By coming to know Him before the person. So
						we need to spend more time with God by reading His word, praying,
						accountability in small groups (Some of us are dealing with real
						issues and James tells us to confess our sins one to another, pray
						for each other and that's how we get healing because it's not just
						in you being layed hands on but in also releasing it and seeing
						God's church surround you in love and be free).
					</p>
					<p>
						At times when we're praying it doesn't feel like anything's
						happening. It just starts to feel a little juicy on Sundays, but dry
						through out the week. But anything that worth doing, is worth doing
						continually. So that's why you need to get the discipline. And
						there's some point that the things in our life that have been
						defining us start to be overtaken by God's word. But when we stop
						letting God pour into our lives, we become lukewarm. So you can post
						anything on IG because you don't have your identity. And it's your
						birthday so you can go out and have a little fun. And you're
						stressed so you can drink because that's what you do to release. But
						you still profess God is good all the time. But from afar, what's
						visible? They might not even note there's anything underneath. The
						same way they see our hypocrisy, us being ruled by the flesh, and
						God says don't feel judged by that, just let me take control of
						everything.
					</p>
					<p>
						When the lies come back, they can only stay on the surface. So when
						the enemy comes to lie, it can't stick. Allow God to take control
						and fill you up becuase when He does it, nothing the enemy throws
						will be able to take root.
					</p>
					<p>
						For some of us we now understand, God has not been holding the
						relationship back from you, He's been holding it back for you. So
						that business partner you've been corning to be your business
						partner so till you let God take full control, He can't let them
						come because they can come when you're filled and they can correct
						your dressing, attitude and it only stays on the surface.
					</p>
					<p>So if God's not enough, no person ever will be.</p>
					<p>
						when the purpose of something is not known, abuse will be
						inevitable.
					</p>
					<p>
						After all these five things is when God said, it's not good for the
						man to be alone. With all of that, it's not good to be alone. So he
						made a helper just like him. So there's friends, lovers, business
						partners just like you.

					<h1>Law of growth and Power of mindset</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="blog_body">
					<p>from Apostle Joshua Selman (YouTube) - 26_11_21</p>
					<p>
						You can never find money and don't even look for it. Money is
						attracted by what you are becoming more than what you do.
					</p>
					<p>
						Becoming is more important than doing and your evolution and
						transformation is greater than what you do.
					</p>
					<p>
						But the people than know their God shall do exploits. Notice it
						starts with knowledge, transformation then action.
					</p>
					<p>
						The mindset doing the business is the one that makes it fail.
						Difference between failures and those who succeed is the mindset.
					</p>
					<p>
						The body is only an instrument of execution and is usually obedient
						to your mind. Your body is only a slave to your thinking.
					</p>
					<p>
						When the Holy Spirit wants to build you, He'll first transform you.
						The confusion about our lives is because of refusing to be
						transformed.
					</p>
					<p>Take time to grow yourself.</p>
					<p>
						The concept of just give and your life will be transformed is not
						true. The level of mental transformation that can take the favor and
						turn it into a blessing is at times not there. The prophet saw the
						problem was not the oil. The problem was the capacity.
					</p>
					<p>
						Don't fake anything and don't rush the season in your life.
						Transformation is wealth that never fails.
					</p>
					<p>
						Great men have a level of transformation that does not allow them to
						face certain types of problems or some conditions.
					</p>
					<p>
						There's a level of mindset that when you get to, even with nothing
						in your hands, the law of God's justice will force you to have the
						resources to match that mindset.
					</p>
					<p>
						What you do is not the problem. It's who you are. At times it's only
						your body that is in a certain place like a one room house but your
						mindset is way ahead of your current situation.
					</p>
					<p>
						Focus on growing and everything else around you will start to grow.
						Everything is waiting for you to grow to grow too.
					</p>
					<p>
						There's a way life is programmed and there are things we need to get
						us to our destiny but the hustle of finding one thing at a time is
						not a burden God gave us.
					</p>
					<p>
						Every realm and every level in your life has the possibilities
						attached to it to come. If at level 1, there's something that should
						come with that level.
					</p>
					<p>
						You don't attract anything by getting them, you bring them by
						growing. When you focus on growing, you don't even see the things
						you need coming to you, they just come because they are attracted to
						your growth and eventually you can't even force then our of your
						life.
					</p>
					<p>
						Everything you are looking for is also looking for you, but it's not
						looking for this version of you. Like you can't sit in business
						class with only $1000 in your pocket. You're still not there.
					</p>
					<p>
						When you grow, everything around you grows to support that realm.
					</p>
					<p>
						Keep learning and God on the other hand will summon your destiny
						helpers. It's called the law of time and chance and God supervises
						this law.
					</p>
					<p>
						Once you make some progress, it's proof that the law is working so
						keep engaging this laws and a time will come when you can't push
						anything away because your growth has brought it to your life.
					</p>
					<p>Success is designed to follow growth not just desires.</p>
					<p>
						Small success should just encourage you to keep working. Remember
						growth is something that must always keep going on in your life.
					</p>
					<p>
						If in case you start to have pride because of small success then
						everything including you can go back to step 0.
					</p>
					<p>
						Today, most people feel ashamed of process. But never live a fake
						life just because you want to give a narrative.
					</p>
					<p>If you eat tomorrow's bread today, you will starve tomorrow.</p>
					<p>
						Until you can give to the kingdom without inconvenience, you're
						still not there.
					</p>
					<p>
						Focus on the principles of God that tomorrow will be better than
						today.
					</p>
					<p>
						There's a level that when you get to, your helpers must remember
						you.
					</p>
					<p>
						There's nothing like luck, it's just people rising to the place
						where their minds have always been.
					</p>
					<p>
						Kingdom and mental transformation can't allow you to remain at the
						same place you have always been at.
					</p>
					<p>DON'T FOCUS ON GETTING, FOCUS ON GROWING.</p>
					<p>
						It's your mindset that even affects how you're treated. The day you
						rise, everything else around you changes.
					</p>
					<p>
						Packaging without mental upgrade will only lead you to frustration.
					</p>
					<p>
						If physically you're still not there but by faith and spirit you are
						there, be patient and walk with the dignity of kingdom integrity.
						Focus more on becoming than doing. Do but only after you have
						become.
					</p>
					<p>
						Your physical environment will gradually and eventually reflect the
						true state of your mindset.
					</p>
					<p>
						For the mind to be renewed you must have access to superior word
						based ideas and information.
					</p>
					<p>
						You need repetition of teachings, information and ideas until
						conviction is established. Hearing once may fail to bring
						transformation. There's materials you have to listen to multiple
						times.
					</p>
					<p>
						The goal is not for information but transportation into your mind
						until it becomes true.

					<h1>Must Dos to prosper</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="blog_body">
					<p>from Apostle Joshua Selman (YouTube) - 29_12_2021</p>
					<p>We do not reign or excel by mistake.</p>
					<p>
						Speed, deliverance, prosperity, influence, power are not by mistake.
						It's a product of keeping and walking with divine patterns.
					</p>
					<p>
						The glory of God comes as proof and signature that His divine
						patterns have been kept for that dimension of glory. Before glory
						Moses asked for God's ways.
					</p>
					<p>
						Express gratitude in thankgiving from the heart in recognition of
						and to the greatness and faithfulness of God.
					</p>
					<p>
						Be grateful enough. communicate that gratitude to give a perception.
						Don't stop until your gratitude is felt.
					</p>
					<p>
						When people thank you truly you become indebted to them. You're
						motivated to do more again.
					</p>
					<p>Don't be late to give thanks.</p>
					<p>
						What someone is fasting and praying for can come to you as a gift
						because you are grateful.
					</p>
					<p>
						One of the greatest things about David was not the dexterity of his
						exploits but the depth of his gratitude.
					</p>
					<p>
						Two main thoughts in Psalm are thanksgiving and deliverance (Power
						of God to heal, save and deliver).
					</p>
					<p>
						Be grateful to God and to men else you cancel opportunities for
						newer and greater levels.
					</p>
					<p>God takes gratitude as proof maturity and responsibility.</p>
					<p>
						One of the indices that can measure the maturity of a believer is
						the fortitude and aptness to say thank you.
					</p>
					<p>Walk in gratitude all the days of your life.</p>
					<p>
						Count your blessings, name them one by one. It keeps you aware of
						what God has done.
					</p>
					<p>
						It is the mercy of God for you to be minding your own business than
						someone thinks about you for good in this wicked and bedeviled
						world.
					</p>
					<p>Thank God even for the transformation of the mind.</p>

					<h1>Yearly Evaluations</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="blog_body">
					<p>from Apostle Joshua Selman (YouTube) - 31_12_2021</p>
					<p>Have a day or two where you have an honest retreat with God.</p>
					<p>In the retreat make sure you do:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Personal thanksgiving</li>
						<li>
							Appraisal
							<ul>
								<li>upraise the year in light of scripture</li>
								<li>sit down and ask what assignment God has given you</li>
								<li>ask how you have lived that year of 2021</li>
								<li>to go forward you must look back and ask questions</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>6 areas to review:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Spiritual growth and progress - Can you sincerely say you've grown
							spiritually?
						</li>
						<li>
							Level of mental transformation - Have you sustained superior
							beliefs or have you maintained your old, wrong and faulty
							thinking. Have you experienced mental maturity?
						</li>
						<li>
							Health - Pay attention to your health. Have you been eating
							healthy? How many times have you been fasting in a week? Have you
							been spending more on your clothes than your health?
						</li>
						<li>
							Financial Progress - Ensure you're not making careless and wrong
							decisions. Look back and see what God has given you then look at
							how much you have left. Are there any wrong companies that made
							you eat up all your finances? Are there business decisions you
							rushed and lost money? Did you spend money carelessly?
						</li>
						<li>
							Your purpose and your destiny - Life is separated into four
							seasons: Morning, afternoon, evening, night. 0 - 25 is your
							morning stage. 26 - 50 is your afternoon stage. 51 - 75 is your
							evening stage. After 75 is your night stage. Ensure you do what
							needs to be done in your season. Don't take tasks for one season
							to the other season. Find what you will spend the rest of your
							life doing as far as God's kingdom in concerned. Jesus spent 30
							years preparing for 3 years of effective ministry and 3 hours on
							the cross to finish the work. Don't dare die with any potential.
							You're getting older each year and there's a time that comes when
							you cannot walk again. Like how you have to retire from football
							after 50 years. Know there's timing to desity and contend for the
							grace of speed.
						</li>
						<li>
							Your relationships - Ensure you have advantageous connections and
							relationships. We rise and thrive on the strength of the kind and
							quality of relationships that we have. Walk with the wise and you
							will be wise yourself.
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						IT'S NOT NECESSARILY HOW LONG WE LIVE, IT'S HOW EFFECTIVE WE LIVE.
					</p>
					<p>
						After making your evaluations, make a decision to bring a systematic
						dimension to your life.
					</p>
					<p>
						Put systems in your life that ensure continuity and predictability.
					</p>
					<p>
						Don't just pray in a while or read the Bible once in a while. Pray,
						study and fast every time.
					</p>
					<p>Plan for the coming week, month and year.</p>
					<p>Fail to plan and you naturally plan to fail.</p>
					<p>
						Don't just enter the year as you are. Plan for every month. Even if
						you don't achieve at least let it be that you set goals.
					</p>
					<p>
						Visionary people and leaders have a secret to efficiency, they don't
						just stumble into their days, they plan.
					</p>
					<p>Achieve something every month that brings glory to God.</p>
					<p>Use the resources you have to be a blessing to someone.</p>
					<p>
						Be a giver. God designed the system of giving such that givers will
						never truly lack.

					<h1>Power of knowledge</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="blog_body">
					<p>from Apostle Joshua Selman (YouTube) - 16_02_22</p>
					<p>John 11:35 Jesus cried at Lazarus' grave because of love.</p>
					<p>
						Luke 19:41 Jesus cries because of how people are guessing their
						lives without knowing what's responsible for their peace and
						results. Because it's hidden from their eyes.
					</p>
					<p>
						This is a kingdom of information and light. Dominion in this kingdom
						is a product of knowledge. Not desire or intention, but knowledge
						and sufficient knowledge.
					</p>
					<p>It is better total ignorance than partial knowledge.</p>
					<p>
						There's a level of knowledge it takes for dominion to be true. Must
						be sufficient to a degree that can bring you the result that you
						desire.
					</p>
					<p>1 Cor 8:2 We don't know as we ought to.</p>
					<p>
						Proof that you're knowledgeable is a desire in you to know more.
					</p>
					<p>
						The sense of arrival and complacency is a symptom of insufficient
						knowledge.
					</p>
					<p>Let there remain a hunger in you for more.</p>
					<p>
						All we desire in the kingdom of God has been made available by grace
						but it takes faith and knowledge that is correct.
					</p>
					<p>Object of your faith must be authentic.</p>
					<p>Is your knowledge to the degree it can give you results?</p>
					<p>
						Through knowledge shall the just be delivered. There's a
						relationship between deliverance and knowledge. Not all spirit go by
						prayer. There's a kind that goes by prayer, another by prayer and
						fasting, another by knowledge. The devourer does not go by fasting
						or knowledge but by obedience to a correct information.
					</p>
					<p>We reign on the strength of the light we have.</p>
					<p>
						In Hosea it says, my people perish for lack of knowledge. Not
						necessarily the heathen. See life from a perspective and the result
						of that aberration is the pain and discomfort.
					</p>
					<p>
						You don't stop crying just because you're tired of crying, you stop
						crying when light is now enough to turn your darkness to day.
						Weeping endures for the night.
					</p>
					<p>Desire in itself is not enough. It takes knowledge.</p>
					<p>
						God has always wanted to bless us but you only arise and shine when
						your light has come. Not when the light is available. It has always
						been available.
					</p>
					<p>
						A womb can always receive seed but that doesn't automatically make
						you pregnant. The day a seed enters the womb, then conception
						starts.
					</p>
					<p>when God wants to change your life, He grants you knowledge.</p>
					<p>
						The strength of victimization and oppression is withholding
						classified information from people. World powers have that name
						because of access to classified information.
					</p>
					<p>
						We reign in this kingdom because of access to information and
						knowing what to do and it is by good mastery to what you must do.

					<h1>Being Intentional</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="blog_body">
					<p>from Apostle Joshua Selman (YouTube) - 17_02_22</p>
					<p>Be intentional about the presence of God.</p>
					<p>
						Miracles are not magic, they are proof that there is a God in heaven
						and He is alive and mighty and He loves.
					</p>
					<p>
						Sometimes believers can be careless with the presence of God. Jacob
						was careless with an encounter that would change his life and as a
						result of the carelessness he paid for the next 20 years. Next
						encounter was pain in the house of Laban. In chapter 32 he was more
						stronger, more discerning and more intentional. He hold on and never
						let go.
					</p>
					<p>
						Don't just celebrate what God is doing in the life of others or in
						the house. Have the determination of Elisha to receive from Elijah.
						Don't be distracted.
					</p>
					<p>
						There is something about the power and the grace of God in the midst
						of His people.
					</p>
					<p>
						People come into the church for several reasons. There's those who
						come as spectators, some are sent by God to the meeting because
						something about destiny connected to them needs to be unveiled,
						others are sent because they are God's final sign of mercy over
						their families that if they miss that opportunity.
					</p>
					<p>
						So it's important that we don't be careless, believers have turned
						church and we've had all kinds of experiences but this is not a
						place for show. We must be serious with God.
					</p>
					<p>
						The price of every destiny is the blood of Jesus. We can't afford to
						toy and play games with God's people.
					</p>
					<p>
						People have come with burdens, others pain, others troubles, other
						passion and desire to be directed and to be mentored, others have
						come to take the fire like those in ministry and it might not be
						working yet you know there is a way, this is the answer to the
						things you've been asking God for.
					</p>
					<p>
						There is prayer investment, word investment and spiritual discipline
						that goes in for one service.

					<h1>3 Areas the devil attacks</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="blog_body">
					<p>from Apostle Joshua Selman (YouTube) - 17_02_22</p>
					<p>The devil isolates the church so as to fight the church.</p>
					<p>
						ONE is by attacking the membership of the church. He makes sure
						members start declining. There's online and the rich of the internet
						but it is better for God to bring people rather than bring a view.
					</p>
					<p>
						For as long as there's one sinner and one person that loves Jesus,
						let them find their way into the church.
					</p>
					<p>
						Lack of soul winning can cause people to even stop going to church.
						As a result these are the same people that become leaders and they
						no longer know how to honor God because they have not been trained.
					</p>
					<p>
						Every generation respects what they grew with. If not with the fear
						of God don't expect that later they will just come and honor God.
					</p>
					<p>
						Train up a child in the way he should go and when he grows he will
						not turn away from it. Doesn't just mean the one you gave birth to
						physically.
					</p>
					<p>
						Be intentional and go after souls. Souls are not just in another
						church, they are in a beer parlour and many places that need the
						power and move of God.
					</p>
					<p>
						Don't just go for people who are already matured and processed.
						Bring people and start from the beginning. Go to the byways and
						compel them to come and begin to build them.
					</p>
					<p>
						A good leader does not just make followers. He transforms followers
						into leaders then makes the leaders agents of change.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you are not about souls and revealing Jesus, teaching doctrine,
						discipleship, be ready for empty pus.
					</p>
					<p>
						Carry the responsibility of a visionary once you're teaching people
						no matter the level. Departmental, house cell, withing the larger
						house. Give seriousness and intention to everything that is being
						done.
					</p>
					<p>TWO is an attack on the supernatural (signs and wonders).</p>
					<p>
						John 4:29-35 and 48 - This was a woman whose problem was known by
						all and after what Jesus did she was too grateful to keep quiet.
						Verse 48, except yee see signs and wonders, yee will not believe.
					</p>
					<p>
						We can't keep quiet about what God is doing. Not exaggerated
						testimonies or lies. Genuine miracles that happen.
					</p>
					<p>
						Keeping quiet is like shutting the manifestation of the glory of
						God. Testimonies are powerful tools that glorify the name of God.
						The Bible did not keep quiet over the things that God did.
					</p>
					<p>
						John 20:30 - many miracles are not recorded in this book but this
						are recorded that you might believe and in believing you will have
						eternal life.
					</p>
					<p>
						Testimonies are more than an attestation that a man of God is
						anointed. You are letting people know that Jesus is alive.
					</p>
					<p>
						Let the discussion be about what God is doing in our midst even in
						the midst of unbelievers. That the new will be too many for them to
						even discuss in their midst because even the least in the church is
						anointed.
					</p>
					<p>
						Something about human beings and Africans is that they always go to
						where the news is happening. Even if it's to verify. God knows how
						to prepare for those people because their testimonies will be more
						powerful. They doubted openly so they will acknowledge openly.
					</p>
					<p>
						Believe in miracles, signs and wonders as they also play part in
						growth.
					</p>
					<p>THIRD is an attack on finances.</p>
					<p>
						Keep going because time doesn't change anything but instead it
						reveals and it's such a brutal teacher that it can teach men a lot.
					</p>
					<p>
						Many servants can compromise because of lack of finances. So we
						ought to be aware of the god of gold.
					</p>
					<p>
						Lack of finances can even lead to people leaving their convictions.
					</p>
					<p>
						Many preachers can start well but when generator fuel, bills, paying
						stuff within the ministry - many can end up compromising.
					</p>
					<p>
						To truly be a preacher of righteousness you must obtain grace and
						wisdom from God to sort both your personal and ministerial finances.
						If one is solved and the other is not, then it means you're not
						entirely free.
					</p>
					<p>
						Jesus did not keep quiet about the issue of finances. He paid
						attention the financial needs of the people. He showed He cared for
						the welfare of the people because after preaching and doing
						everything he asked the disciples to give them something to eat. Not
						just the spiritual meal.
					</p>
					<p>
						God cares about our welfare. He cares about our well being. 2 Cor
						9:8 - There's a relationship between all sufficiency and good works.
					</p>
					<p>
						Without all sufficiency there's a limitation to the good works that
						you can do.
					</p>
					<p>
						There's a time when everything around you increases but your
						finances don't and at that time the devil might come because he is a
						master at maximizing desperation.
					</p>
					<p>
						Like you can be a lady and you're dedicated to serving God but then
						again you're in need and ungodly man comes, you might be tempted to
						pick the phone and call.
					</p>
					<p>
						The devil will wait till we prepare precious people then he will
						come and carry them using the god of gold.
					</p>
					<p>
						Gen 42:1-2 - The location could be wrong but the supply is correct.
						The problem is where to look for the corn because it's in Egypt. The
						only thing that takes Israel to Egypt is hunger. When there is
						hunger, even if you're a prophet you will find your way to Egypt.
					</p>
					<p>Learn everything that is needed to excel in ministry.</p>
					<p>When we have needs, it is much easier to compromise.</p>
					<p>
						So let's not just preach righteousness, let's give people the tools
						they need to walk in righteousness.
					</p>
					<p>
						Stop just telling a lady to stop following men yet her mother is
						dying in the village with 11 children and she's the first person who
						was able to stand, she has nothing but a beautiful face. Then her
						mother comes from the village asking if that's how she'll die so the
						lady says she'll do anything without caring.
					</p>
					<p>
						A pit as to why many people don't stay with God is the presence of
						needs that overwhelm them.
					</p>
					<p>Don't just condemn people, at times find out their motivation.</p>
					<p>Righteousness is supported by provisions.</p>
					<p>
						The economy of the church is being fought. The balance is to not
						teach about money blindly but to teach prosperity as a tool for
						kingdom advance. When we don't teach that balance, we fuel lust
						among people so even those who are not serious with God will like
						what's being taught because it supports the lust in their hearts.
					</p>
					<p>God is a provider, can make a way and can bless people.</p>

					<h1>Knowledge of fasting</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="blog_body">
					<p>from Apostle Joshua Selman (YouTube) - 24_11_21</p>
					<p>
						Fasting is not just abstinence from food but abstinence from food
						for the sake of seeking God. If you are not seeking God then that is
						not fasting.
					</p>
					<p>Fasting has always been a sacrifice. It's not a gift.</p>
					<p>
						Don't allow food to take away the place of an encounter that can
						change your life forever.
					</p>
					<p>
						All people that walk with God authentically fast. Not just as a
						ritual.
					</p>
					<p>
						What food is to your sustenance is what fasting is to your spiritual
						growth and you can't ever outgrow food.
					</p>
					<p>
						Fasting is a sacrifice designed by God for our lifting. Jesus taught
						when you fast not if you fast.
					</p>
					<p>
						There's individual and corporate fast. Corporate fasts are demanded
						by God when He has something in mind.

					<h1>Greatest enemy of destiny</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="blog_body">
					<p>from Bishop David Oyedepo (YouTube) - 16_02_22</p>
					<p>
						No one truly sees what will change his story and ignore it. It's not
						being able to see it that keeps people docile.
					</p>
					<p>You can't see the help you're looking for and ignore it.</p>
					<p>
						You can't recognize the key to the door you want to see open and
						despise it.
					</p>
					<p>No situation can render the word of God ineffective.</p>
					<p>
						Every instruction from God requires promptness for maximum delivery.
					</p>
					<p>Belated response can be costly.</p>
					<p>Procrastination is one of the greatest enemies of destiny.</p>
					<p>
						Every vision demands a run for delivery. The faster our response,
						the faster the delivery.
					</p>
					<p>Life is a race that only answers to committed runners.</p>
					<p>Sleepers don't have a place in the race of life.</p>
					<p>
						People besieged by the spirit of slumber don't have a place in the
						race of life.
					</p>
					<p>
						To win a prize, you must be awake and strong and dedicated to win
						the race.
					</p>
					<p>
						We need to move with the sound of the whistle. You're trained to
						respond to the sound of the gun not when the sound is over.
					</p>
					<p>A great start is vital in determining who wins the prize.</p>
					<p>It takes self-discipline to ever win a prize.</p>

					<h1>3 Things that Test your character</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="blog_body">
					<p>02_22</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Power - Reveals character. God gave character before power because
							power without character will just ruin you. Power does not
							corrupt, it just reveals corruption.
						</li>
						<li>Money</li>
						<li>Access to sex</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Your character is as strong as the temptation you fell for.</p>
					<p>The only way to test character is through temptation.</p>
					<p>To tempt or temper means to search for weakness.</p>
					<p>In life you'll never be free of temptations.</p>
					<p>Tempting is constant in life to measure your character.</p>
					<p>Satan will always tempt you with what you already are.</p>
					<p>The greatest danger is ignorance of self.</p>
					<p>Ignorance will make you disbelieve yourself.</p>
					<p>
						The race is not to the swift, but to him who endures to the end.
					</p>
					<p>will you still be standing after the longest of time?</p>
					<p>
						We have a mandate to dominate earth with God's character. Like a
						king and your territory is earth.
					</p>
					<p>Image is character.</p>

					<h1>Reasons why there are many failed youths today</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="blog_body">
					<p>from Bishop David Oyedepo (YouTube) - 15_02_22</p>
					<p>
						failed children in most cases are failed parents (No instruction, no
						corrections, petting until everything goes off course).
					</p>
					<p>it's never early to learn how to enjoy successful parenting.</p>
					<p>any evil you pet today is digging a grave for tomorrow.</p>
					<p>
						any family where anything goes is a failed family. Any family
						without established boundaries, has lost their future.
					</p>
					<p>
						The remaining days you have under the care of your parents, gently
						and honourably subscribe to every positive instruction that they
						give you. Subscribe to it so that your children can hear you
						tomorrow.
					</p>
					<p>
						Everything you do is a seed. You despise your parents today, your
						children will despise you tomorrow. You honor them today, your
						children will honor you tomorrow.
					</p>
					<p>The cost is unbearable.</p>
					<p>
						The children you cannot instruct today, will disrupt your program
						tomorrow.
					</p>
					<p>
						Anyone that has a child in prison, the father is more imprisoned
						than the man. He's cautious where he goes and mockers are all over
						the place. Keep quiet, isn't your son in prison?
					</p>
					<p>
						So what's the way out? Train up a child in the way that he will go.
						Command them to walk the right path. Don't discuss, command.
					</p>
					<p>To have failed children, is to be a failed man.</p>
					<p>You're a child today, but you're a parent tomorrow.</p>
					<p>
						If you've hurt your parents, call and apologise sincerely and ask
						for forgiveness. Many children may not find their way forward except
						they receive forgiveness from their parents.

				<h1 class="blog_title">Assets that make you rich</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="blog_body">
				<p>from Robert Kiyosaki (YouTube)</p>
				<p>Studying hard just to get a job is not wealth. It's just a job and you can get fired. Instead, work for assets.</p>
				<p>There's four asset classes:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Business - starting a company like Google, Apple</li>
					<li>Real Estate - be an entrepreneur in business and also in real estate because that way you pay no taxes and end up getting more money. Without real estate, you pay taxes</li>
					<li>Paper - stocks, bonds, mutual funds and saving are liquid since you make a mistake, you can go in and out real quick. Problem with business and real estate is if you make a mistake, you're stuck forever.</li>
					<li>commodities - like oil since your tax breaks. There's also metals like gold, silver, guns and bullets because well, if you have something, someone's going to try and steal it.</li>
				</ol>

				<h1 class="blog_title">Why so many CEOs are engineers</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="blog_body">
				<p>These day, the heads of the most successful business have one thing in common; they are engineers.</p>
				<p>Getting an MBA used to be the way to go but not anymore.</p>
				<p>As a CEO is more important to focus on the product as a good products means the profits will follow rather than focusing on boring board meetings.</p>
				<p>A CEO who is an engineer has the advantage of being able to design, build, create and improve their product because of their background in math, science and technology and they can even help solve technical problems that can sattle your dreams.</p>
				<p>Math and ecomonics might be helpful in balancing the books but for a business to become great, innovation is required.</p>
				<p>Industry should not respect tradition - it should only respect innovation</p>
				<p>Innovation is however not easy, it requires taking risky moves and not accepting failures. Like Thoman Edison said - I've not failed, I've only found 10,000 ways that won't work.</p>
				<p>Be invested in the fine details of your company and get involved in the day to day business especially when it comes to hiring.</p>
				<p>When it comes to interviews, what should be sorted after is the ability to have an analytical approach to come up with an informed answer.</p>
				<p>The discipline of engineering teaches you about problem solving and that's all a business really is.</p>
				<p>Maths and computer science are good foundations for understanding how the world works.</p>

				<h1 class="blog_title">Tips for Team Success</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="blog_body">
				<ol>
					<li>Help each team member understand the value of the business.</li>
					<li>Ensure everyone understands their role and how to do their tasks and the outcomes expected from them. Not just their tasks but also the required standards.</li>
					<li>Good Communication structure. Have a meeting of at least 20 minutes each week, not just to discuss work but also to connect. Like discuss what people are currently working on and what they've finished working on. The team should never feel like they are guessing what they should be doing.</li>
					<li>The team should know how well they're doing. Have a feedback loop where you can appreciate the work the team is doing. In case of problems or failures, avoid focusing on what's not working and focus instead on how things could work.</li>

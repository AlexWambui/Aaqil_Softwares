                <h2 class="blog_content_h2">General Guidelines</h2>
                <p>These are guidelines applied to all transcriptions.</p>
                <p>Two types of guidelines: Clean Read and Verbatim.</p>
                <p>Job-specific guidelines take precedence.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="blog_content">
                <h2 class="blog_content_h2">Clean Read Overview</h2>
                <p>ensures transcript is concise and clear, without interruptions.</p>
                <p>omits any stutters, filler words, interruptions, partial words and false starts.</p>
                <p>transcriptions should be free of slang, irrelevant interjections and non-verbal communications</p>
                <p>And should not begin a sentence. Either omit it or connect 2 sentences using and in between.</p>
                <p>maintain meaning of the sentence.</p>
                <p>words like so at the start of a sentence are not always filler words. if a speaker begins many thoughts with so, you can likely omit it. However, if the word so could be replaced with therefore, and maintain the meaning, leave it in.</p>
                <p>no need to expand words like it's, that's, etc, you've, you'll and more of this sort.</p>
                <p>when describing interface buttons and menu buttons, ensure you capitalize them and use double quotes. Tabs and page names should be capitalized. Double quotes should only be used when describing an action of clicking a button.</p>
                <p>Example: Now that we're inside the extension, I'm going to press "Upload" and choose the file that I want to upload and click "Okay". Then come back to the Install page.</p>

                <p>ensure everything the speaker utters is written.</p>
                <p>For stutters, partial words and false starts, use a dash.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stutter: I- I- I'm going shopping</li>

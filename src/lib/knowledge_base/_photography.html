            <p>16mm gives a wide background so the focus appears compressed. 50mm is close to what the eye sees. 106mm magnifies the focus so the face of a person would appear flat and it's only a little bit of the background that appears in the photo.</p>

            <p>from YouTube - 23_02_2022</p>
            <p>In cinematography, it's better to shoot in manual mode rather than auto mode.</p>
            <p>The 5 basics are:</p>
            <p>*** Frame rate</p>
            <p>Frame rate refers to how many frames are in one second of your video.</p>
            <p>As of the moment, the industry's frame rate is 24FPS which is cinematic and what's used in hollywood films.</p>
            <p>It's the same as what the natural eye would see.</p>
            <p>For videos to be edited in slow motion, shoot in 60FPS or 120FPS then slow down by 40% in the editing software for a butterly smooth.</p>
            <p>*** ISO (also called Fake Light)</p>
            <p>Usually labelled with ISO - use the exposure to adjust the ISO and shutter speed.</p>
            <p>This should be the last setting.</p>
            <p>It is a way to make images darker or lighter.</p>
            <p>It's measured to 200, 000. The higher the number, the brighter the image.</p>
            <p>A major downside is it produces noise / grain which makes it look TV static.</p>
            <p>Most cameras start to get noisy at about 1600 ISO.</p>
            <p>Keep the ISO as low as possible to avoid grain in your image.</p>
            <p>*** Shutter Speed - refers to how long your image is exposed to the world.</p>
            <p>It's usually at the middle.</p>
            <p>The shutter speed is like the eyelid to the camera that opens and closes to allow an image to be taken and be saved in the SD card.</p>
            <p>The shutter speed makes your image light or darker.</p>
            <p>Slow shutter speed will take bright images. Fast shutter speed prevents lots of light so images are darker and have better quality.</p>
            <p>Shutter speed also affects the motion blur.</p>
            <p>Fast shutter speed means there won't be any blur. Slow shutter speed means a blurred image.</p>
            <p>Shutter depends on the mood you want to potray, like normally you would use fast shutter but for things like dreams or someone is about to pass out, you would use slow shutter.</p>
            <p>A general rule of thumb is shutter speed should be double your frame rate.</p>
            <p>So if shooting at 24FPS - shutter speed should be 1/50, Frame rate of 60FPS - shutter speed should be 1/120.</p>
            <p>*** Aperture - is like the eyeball of your camera and it's inside the lens.</p>
            <p>It's also called the F-Stop.</p>
            <p>Has a dot in the middle of it.</p>
            <p>Measures from F22 to F1.8.</p>
            <p>Regulates how much the lens will be open thus controls the light being let into the camera.</p>
            <p>Opens up to allow more light to the camera, and closes to make images darker.</p>
            <p>It affects the depth of field or in other words, how blurry the background is.</p>
            <p>This also means the amount of object in focus becomes smaller.</p>
            <p>Turn down the F-Stop eg. F1.4 and turn down ISO to completely blur the image. Then for F16, just turn up the ISO.</p>
            <p>The lower the F-Stop, the more the blur.</p>
            <p>Use depth of field to aid your story.</p>
            <p>The lower the aperture can get the more expensive the lens will be, like lenses that can get down to F1.8.</p>
            <p>*** White Balance - tells your camera what is pure white.</p>
            <p>There's some presets like: daylight, tungsten light, shade, cloudy and you can set a custom kelvin temperature.</p>
            <p>Automatic tells the camera to place whatever color and this can be dangerous.</p>
            <p>Can be easily set using a grey card.</p>
            <p>You can also buy an ND filter for really bright scenarios as it allows you to set high ISO while still getting clear images.</p>

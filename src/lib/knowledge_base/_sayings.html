            <p>Good role models have the power to create 1000 more.</p>
            <p>The tongue can slay you. Hold it if you don't know how to use it.</p>
            <p>Thinking is just the beginning, change comes when you start doing actions.</p>
            <P>What you think affects what you do.</P>
            <p>Everybody needs a friend that can look out for their best interest.</p>
            <p>It's about how you respond not what has happened to you.</p>
            <p>In crisis look at the opportunities. There's no crisis, only opportunities.</p>
            <p>What you see is what you give birth to and it's what you become. Be careful about what you set your eyes on and what you see.</p>
            <p>connect completely, mentally, spiritually and you are incredibly attracted to physically.</p>
            <p>from movie - infinite 2021 ... Ever had a dream that felt so real like it was a memory. Ever caught yourself in the mirror by surprise as though you expected to see somebody else stare back at you? Are there things you just know how to do? Like no one's ever showed you. Somehow, each step in the process makes sense. Like you're remembering it. Not learning it.</p>
            <p>In school it's not about your grades but more importantly about the hands you shake.</p>
            <p>Some people call you at their free time, others free their time to call you.</p>
            <p>Have a why for each and everything you do.</p>
            <p>We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit. (Aristotle)</p>
            <p>You don't get in life what you are. You get what you are.</p>
